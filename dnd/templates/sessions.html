            Solved a puzzle in the fountain to open the door.<br>
            Explored 4 rooms, 3 stairwells, and a hidden hallway on the ground floor.<br>
            The basement contained a prison as well as a hidden portal that reset the players to when they first entered the castle.<br>
            And the second floor contained 8 bedrooms, with 3 portals to a mystical version of the bedrooms, two with monsters and the third contained <a href="/dnd/party#akta">a Tiefling friend!</a><br>

            <a href='/dnd/party'>The gang</a> decided to headup one of the main spiral staircases (rather than our Hidden set they used to get here).<br>
            As they climbed, everyone felt a very odd sensation, though could not identify anything wrong, and finished the climb to the next floor.<br>
            Here they found a similar layout as the last floor, just with offices instead of bedrooms!<br>
            Here they found portals, that lead them to more fights and some silver, as well as a journal that told them the inhabitants were from 200 years prior.<br>
            After finishing that floor, they climbed the grand staircase to the Throne Room!<br>
            They had a...less than helpful conversation with a Kenku named Yordar and then proceeded to kill his kobold soldiers before lighting a fire in the window and heading back down to await pickup!<br>

            He informed them that news had ALREADY spread of their success and adventure with requests coming in for heros! They set off immediately!<br>
            They headed to Elytos, where the local University's all centaur frat, ΗΟΡΣE, need help cleaning their toilet(basement) and the party decided to leave for Demaphos instead.<br>
            Demaphos had need of catching a lion, which they visited the cave of after meeting Lieutenant Daniel Pickles.<br>
            The party got split in a maze inside the cave and the Lion attacked!!!<br>
            After killing the lion, it was revealed that Lt. Pickles was a Werelion who worked his way into the Police Force to stay secret!<br>
            The Party collected the payment (637 gp) from the Captain and headed home to Hose!<br>

            This was our PC Intro session!<br>
            We roleplayed the road to Elytos! There were 2 days of uninterrupted horseback riding.<br>
            Our players introduced themselves, <a href="/dnd/party">giving a brief bit of info about themselves</a> before moving on to asking questions, learning about each other, and just roleplaying together!

        <h2><span id="five">Session Five</span></h2>
        <p>
            <a href="/dnd/party">Our wacky crew of adventurers</a> were instructed to give the horses a rest before heading off on their next heroic quest -- To Help the Mad Cows of Philonia, before their Festival of Phaethusa!<br>
            On the road they fought, and killed, two owlbear cubs but with no mother in sight, the party rested up and continued on to Philonia, arriving the morning Of the Festival!<br>
            Wasting no time at all the party investigated the cows and their field and saw just how mad they were - Wrench got bit on the hand trying to heal one!<br>
            They saw that the local Hat Factory (which provides fanciful, and slightly magic, hats to the Hattery In Town) was upstream from the main water source for the cows and thought they should investigate the Hattery and then the Factory as well.<br>
            Pissed off the Hatter (Todd) but <a href="/dnd/party#duvu">Duvu</a> stole a Violently Purple Top Hat fitted Perfectly to <a href="/dnd/party#adelvir">Adelvir</a>, before they were kicked out of course!<br>
            At the factory, they stood a better chance, as <a href="/dnd/party#akta">Akta</a> was able to charm the floor manager, Polo Fleetfoot, into showing them the main factory floor -- AND the restricted section where they have their R&D department!<br>
            Upstairs in R&D, they met a Half-orc Wizard named Gerta who informed them of the weather proofing potion and its Maddening side effects!!!<br>
            Akta, having charmed him still, was able to learn from Polo that the factory simply washed away the leftover potion and dumped it into the stream every night, thereby discovering the exact cause of the Mad Cows!<br>
            Adelvir had already taken it upon himself to flirt up a storm with Gerta and managed to convince her to give them the antidote for free to fix the cows, figure out a safer way to magically weather-proof the hats, AND sleep with him!<br>
            As thanks for discovering this, and fixing it, the Mayor of Philonia provided them his sigil, informing them that they need only show that to any vendor tonight at the festival and they would be paid for!<br>
            As the final thanks, the Wonderful Organizer of the Festival, Alyssa, encouraged them to stay for the Festival and provided them the 300 gold pieces that she, the ranchers, and others in the village were able to scrape together as thanks!<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="six">Session Six</span></h2>
        <p>
        After much drinking and enjoying themselves at the Festival, the party made their way home to Hose! Once they arrived, they found that Uzul had an advisor from the village named Cebeus...That not everyone recognized, despite the insistance that he'd been living in Hose for years...
        Cebeus indicated that he knew what could help get rid of the castle in the field! The party would need to find the "Amulet of Ichor", which he believes to be in the <b>Labyrinth Of Dawnrise</b> under the Temple to Eos (which turned out to be under the Temples to Artemis and Apollo! in Tropolis! But he didn't think they were ready yet! They should go handle the Dirty Bathroom in Elytos first.
        They were successful in cleaning it up and then found a hidden temple of sorts underground! Where they made their way through puzzles and collected a bag of magic rings and also discovered a secret Dark Light Candle.
        Upon completion of this task, Cebeus sent tehm off to Find the Amulet of Ichor!
        After some investigation, the party forced their way into the back of the temple to Artemis and found a secret entrance to the Temple of Eos, literally underground the temple.
        The <b>Labyrinth Of Dawnrise</b> turned out to be a series of randomly generated challenges that the party had to navigate. Once through they were invited to sign the book at the end to indicate they won, they completed. This is when they settled on the party name: <b>The Revengers</b>!
        They were also able to trade items with the prize bucket (a literal bucket of magic items) and actually brought enough with them that they could take everything from the bucket, and still leave items behind!
        With the Amulet of Ichor in hand, the party tried to return to Hose, but were intercepted by the mysterious Cascade Circle, who tried to scare them off from working with Cebeus earlier.
        The Circle convinced the party that Cebeus was not who he said he was before tasking them with returning with him.
        This led the party to demand a feast in their honor from Uzul, who met their demands, in order to distract Cebeus and try to confront him in public.
        Before the Revengers could complete their plan, Cebeus picked up on it and fled to his castle!
        Thanks to Wrench's magic helmet, The Revengers could keep up with him and therefore were brought with him when he traveled back in time to escape them!!!
        Once they arrived in the past, the party chased Cebeus through the edge of the battle into town where he was trying to collect an item from the past (The Staff of Zeus, which historically went missing at this battle).
        Once inside the temple to Zeus in town, The Revengers actually talked Cebeus down from killing them and continuing his investigation to revive his dead love.
        They did such a thorough job, that he came peacefully and took them back to their time in order to meet with the Cascade Circle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="seven">Session Seven</span></h2>
        <p>
        The Revengers return Cebeus to The Cascade Circle, who decide they will need 3 days to determine his fate. They will provide enough for the team to sleep and eat for those 3 days in Tropolis, for they will have that time to decide what their reward will be. They each get to choose between 250 GP or choose and item from their inventory to be improved by the Circle.
        The entire party decides to have something improved, thought Krasus specifies how important his Glaive is. If they would be unable to leave it exactly the same it is, he would rather they leave it alone entirely.
        <ul>
            <li>Gisli heard one of her grandsons (Jyota Burdinger) was in the guild district, which most people were surprised about because they'd all heard he was dead.</li>
            <li>Krasus asked a local merchant about the King and government of today. He had generally positive things to say, though he hasn't seen the king as much lately and hes heard rumors of some shit towards Getra.</li>
            <li>Adelvir had Gisli create him a separate-able double ended spear (this became the weapon he got improved by the circle). He also communed with Nyx to learn some information regarding the God of the Underworld and Getra.</li>
            <li>Wrench investigated his past, visiting the temple to Hephaestus and speaking with a temple clerk. They indicated he might not be the original Hephaestus created Warforged, but he does seem older than the current models.</li>
            <li>Finally, Akta went shopping for a new cloak as she was still wearing her indentured servent outfit from 30 years ago.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The Cascade Circle was able to upgrade everyone's equipment and announced that they decided to rehabilitate Cebeus as they believed his remorse and believed that he could recover from this.
        The party then began looking into jobs and found a thieves guild that is okay with colateral damage (fire, specifically) The Hands of Hephaestus. They gave them membership (and some gold) to go investigate their partners in Getra, The Eleusian Mysteries, who take care of the bodies The Hands generate, but they've been ASKING for bodies lately.
        Teleporting closer, The Revengers then rented horses and headed to Getra to investigate...
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="eight">Session Eight</span></h2>
        <p>
        Arriving in Getra, the party found their way to The Boar's Inn, the local tavern, and with some money...and "The Look"...the barkeep, Witha, told them that everyone is in on the things going on.
        They then followed her advice and made their way to what they'd learn is Town Hall! Thanks to a nice enough half-gnome receptionist (whose name the party didn't get) they have an appointment with Ruksha (someone in Town Hall) at 4pm on Friday (it was Tuesday midday). 
        The Revengers then made their way to the Police Department (right next door) to file a false missing persons report for a "large man with brown hair and brown eyes named Phil because he 'fills a doorway'" in order to try and get more information about missing persons from the Police. Unfortunately the polcie was not exactly willing to share info.
        Trying to follow up on the dead bodies and missing people/bodies, the party tried to be more direct and find a shady seller at the market and instead found the town drunk, Din Starborn, a diminuitive Kobold! Din, under some nice cajoling, unloaded a lot of weight onto the party. The fact that everyone in town is in on it because they were forced to make a decision 4ish years ago: Join them or Die. He also told them that Kinstus is the local leader.
        The party delivered Din to the bar, as he requested, but Krasus paid Witha a gold piece to house Din for a few days and to not give him any alcohol...let him sober up. She accepted.
        Following one of the last bits of evidence they had at the moment, they moved to the Mortuary, the place all dead bodies in town should go first. They encountered a tall, bright red Tiefling woman working there. She welcomed them in and tried to answer their questions about "their missing friend Phil" and any extra bodies coming through but when she didn't give them what they wanted, Akta read her mind and found more evidence to investigate the Tomb outside of town. After Akta was done reading her mind, the Tiefling kicked them out yelling at her about reading her mind!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="nine">Session Nine</span></h2>
        <p>
        As the party steps out from the Mortuary, they split apart!<br>
        <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#akta">Akta</a> noted she wanted some time alone, off to explore the outskirts of town to see if she recognize anything, and <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#duvu">Duvu</a> really just needing a drink and to relax some, headed first to the bar in The Boar's Inn before eventually retiring to a room upstairs.<br>
        The remainder, <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#gisli">Gisli</a>, <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#wrench">Wrench</a>, <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#ayayron">Ayayron</a>, <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#krasus">Krasus</a>, and <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#adelvir">Adelvir</a>, discuss their plan of action briefly, before they also settled on heading back to the Boar's Inn to ask Witha where the town Tomb is...Information she gives Gladly!<br>
        "Why its back behind the Mortuary!" forcing The Revengers to about face and head right back from where they came!<br>
        Arriving at the entrance to the tomb in Mid-Afternoon, our heros venture forth, carefully forming a tight marching pattern with light on either side and safety throughout.<br>
        Making their way through the 3 separate levels of the Tomb, our reduced group explored every nook and cranny of the tomb, looking for any sign of missing bodies, secret entrances, or anything of intrigue...<br>
        They (also read as <b>Wrench</b>) even went so far as to disturb some bodies and set some aflame!!!<br>
        After finding nothing (even after Wrench's destructive additions), The Reduced Revengers stayed the Night in the tomb, hoping to catch anyone sneaking in with nefarious intent!!!<br>
        But alas, 12 hours spent in a tomb was for naught! Not a thing was found, secret entrance, body snatchers, or otherwise.<br>
        Frustrated, our adventurers stormed out of the tomb over to Town Hall to confront Smimdap, the half-gnome receptionist. Upon arrival, The Reduced Revengers demanded an earlier appointment and/or an appointment with their Leader!<br>
        Smimdap, knowing the schedule for the next several days off-hand, cooly replied "I gave you the earliest available appointment, thats all you asked for. Plus, Governer Kinstus doesn't have anything available for 3 months!"<br>
        Wrench, driven into a fury at these words, drew upon the dark mysterious power of his <b>Mace of Terror</b> and frightened Smimdap up from his chair, out of the entrance room, and slamming the door shut behind him!<br>
        Wrench and Gisli even gave chase, only to find the door Locked! Gisli first moved to knock the door down before Krasus was able to calm her down...only for Wrench to walk up for his turn, prepared to completely destroy the wooden door with his magic...before he too, was convinced otherwise.<br>
        Then fleeing the Town Hall, The Reduced Revengers gathered up outside and began discussing what to do next...Wait 2 more days till their appointment with Ruksha, find some other clue they might've missed, or do we have a case of murderhobos on our hands?!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="ten">Session Ten</span></h2>
        <p>
        After significant hemming and hawing, The Revengers decided that they would benefit the most from being patient and waiting for their appointment on Friday, instead of burning buildings to the ground...<br>
        The party killed time sleeping, drinking, performing, and standing around like statues (*ahem* Wrench) before making their way to the Town Hall on Friday afternoon.<br>
        Smimdap welcomed them before directing them to follow the Human and Half-orc guards waiting for them. These guards lead them into the hallway to the right, heading all the way to the back of the building and entering into the last office on the right.<br>
        Unfortunately, Ruksha did not immediately convo didn't go well so they killed the guards that came into the meeting with them and kidnapped Ruksha.<br>
        Somehow they escaped into the rolling fields to the north of Getra...hopefully without followers...<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="eleven">Session Eleven</span></h2>
        <p>
        With a semi-willing hostage in tow, The Revengers gather as much information as they can about <i>The Eleusian Mysteries</i> before moving to impact their "production"!<br>
        Following Ruksha to the hidden water entrance to the underground tunnel system, The Revengers eventually decide to burn all of the bodies in the Getra Town Tomb, as the souls have already been sent to Hades, so these are nothing more than potential soldiers for Udgred!<br>
        Upon burning the bodies (and the little boat used to transport them), The Revengers took Ruksha (in order to help him flee) with them and teleported back to Tropolis!<br>
        Once there, they were able to report back to the Hands of Hephaestus (the thieves guidl that hired them to investigate) and request tasks/jobs/adventures...only to be told to come back later...its late and no one has jobs right now.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="twelve">Session Twelve</span></h2>
        <p>
        The Revengers spent their two days wisely! Visiting the town market (to restock on supplies), relaxing or performing at a local bar, and poking fun at the local philosophers!<br>
        Finally, the time came to meet their contact (Villisar Adtumal) to collect!<br>
        Villisar provided them the 100gp (each) that was their fee, informed them of producing fire in their hand as a "sign" to each other, and had to sadly inform them that the Hands had no Need for help as of now...He can't help them...locally, at least.<br><br>
        But if the party is willing to travel, then he Does know of a job:<br>
        Some older members of The Hands of Hephaestus reportedly left (some time ago) to settle down for a quieter life, choosing to settle down in a small forest town by the name of <b>Lissedonia</b>, where they would, unintentionally, realize a need in the community for hunters and protectors, so they formed <b>Artemis' Hunt</b>!<br>
        After informing The Revengers of the travel (15 days total: head North-Northwest along the River Chalcedon to the Base of the <b>Gazanthus Belt</b> to the <b>Atheos Woods</b>), he told them that the Hunt is in need of some Muscle, and they can't provide it right now, so The Revengers would absolutely be helping out a ton.<br>
        Upon learning of their travel time, the party hit the market up again...but this time for travel supplies!<br>
        Buying just enough food to last, the party also decided to grab alcohol! Leaving the market with half a case of the finest elven wine and 20 gallons of a local dwarven Mead, the party found a carriage that would take them to the forest and Set off!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        While traveling, the Revengers saw rolling hills sweeping across the land, Giant forests across the river that seem to devour the light beneath it, and, after crossing the fork in the River Chalcedon (about halfway into the 15 day trip), began to see the top of the Gazanthus Belt!<br>
        The whole party was (at least loosely) familiar with the Oractus Bluffs (the mountain range right beside Tropolis) and thought IT to be large, but the Gazanthus Belt is nothing short of colossal, and towers of the Bluffs!<br>
        <br>
        Almost to their destination, <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#gisli">Gisli</a> and <a href="https://ericdiemerjones.com/dnd/party#adelvir">Adelvir</a> decide to try and have a drinking contest to prevent wasting all of that Mead they bought!<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately for Adevlir, Dwarves are known for their hearty constitution for a reason, Gisli barely even felt the Mead before Adelvir was ill from over indulging.<br>
        Finally arriving, over a fortnight after departing, The Revengers depart from their carriage and set off into the Atheos Woods, as Villisar informed them that the Hunt will find them!<br>
        And he was correct! Not long after entering the forest, an arrow lodged itself in their path and a voice demands to know who they are and who sent them!<br>
        Thankfully they expected something along these lines so they offered up their group name and indicated that Villisar from the Hands of Hephaestus had sent them to help!<br>
        A small elf, later identified as Nysa, dropped down from the trees and escorted them to Lissedonia!<br>
        Once there, the Revengers were able to see that the town was no larger than 2 dozen buildings (most of them appeared small, like homes) and Nysa showed them Artmeis' Hunt's building, one of the few "large" ones in town.<br>
        She then informed them that they typically live off of the land (fungus and small animals), but something has been "attacking" (for lack of a better word) the homes of the animals they hunt, leaving them with a dwindling food supply and clues that point to something more than what the Hunt could handle. Hence the request for muscle!<br>
        As the party began to head out to see the site of the most recent "attack", Nysa produced a small, but important looking, piece of chalk, drew a circle on the ground and handed it to the party, identifying it as "The Minotaur's Chalk".<br>
        "This artifact will act as a compass, with this circle as 'true north', and will bring you back here. Please return this when you are done. I have need of it."<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="thirteen">Session Thirteen</span></h2>
        <p>
            Nysa led our adventurers deep into the forest, winding through the ever tightening trees, before forcing their way into a clearing...where a living bundle of sticks is attacking the nest in the middle of the clearing!<br>
            Clearly caught off-guard by seeing a creature in this clearing, Nysa jumps into action, drawing her long bow, prepared to fight!<br>
            Our party of adventurers did see something...off. Noting greens and yellows on what Nysa indicated is typically JUST a sentient pile of sticks...<br>
            Only for Wrench to demolish the creature in a ball of fire!<br><br>
            Thankfully, Krasus has some experience tracking as Nysa needed to head back to her post but noted the creature HAD left a path this time.<br>
            Almost losing the trail, Krasus was able to do some close comparison, and trusting his gut, to lead them in the correct direction.<br>
            Stepping around a tree, what appeared to be a Different tree turned towards them, sparking The Revengers to attack!!<br><br>
            The treant, alongside some similarly "off" looking Owlbears, did do some damage to The Revengers, including knocking Adevlir out cold for a few moments, but ultimately fell at their hands!<br>
            Another Successful vanquish for our Party!<br>

        <h2><span id="twenty">Session Twenty...ish? I really don't know, just picking a number</span></h2>
        <p>
            <a>As Rizzo stepped out of the warehouse in stepped a beautiful humanoid woman with pale skin and dark hair. Many of you recognize her as Persephone, goddess of agriculture and part ruler of Hades (the place). She steps forward and pleads with you to move quickly in your mission to stop Udgred as she believes her mother, Demeter, will sacrifice herself to give Udgred what he wants in 3 weeks time... At your request, Persephone agrees to try and bring you some sort of gifts (either from her husband, Hades, or her half-brother Hephaestus) within the week to aid in your task, as well as agreeing to try and "talk Gisli up" to Hephaestus, due to her desire to work in his forges after passing.</a><br>
            <a>From there, the Revengers agreed to blindly accept a mission without gold payment from the Hands of Hephaestus in order to have them report constant updates on Gemma until otherwise stated! Sporadically throughout the day, Wrench receives private missives in his ear informing him that Gemma appears to be holed up in the Paláti all day. Between talking to Rizzo about another job (stealing wire art from whomever bought it last night at the party), discussing the Clipper's Guild with Izin, and purchasing various items in the market (including a fun conversation with a gnome merchant, Giddig, who claims to have 17 mouths to feed and sold healing potions, poisons, and ...viagra...?), the Revengers spent the majority of the day in the city, walking all over town. Finally heading back to Revenger Tower in order to explore the tunnels underground.</a><br>
            <a>Once there, Ja'ar Visro told them that he did find a few scrap pieces of paper that noted a couple of the tunnels, which are all labeled with a greek letter. The tunnel that heads to Tropolis is tunnel Α (alpha) and includes some small notation that appears to indicate a shortcut of some kind...Thankfully our sharp eyed rogue and grandma caught glimpse of a faint blue glow before finding a crack in the tunnel that lead to a teleportation circle!!! This circle takes Wrench and Krasus Directly to the other end of the tunnel, Right outside the exit to the tunnel under Tropolis!!! Heading back, Wrench took Gisli and Duvu to find the shortcut mentioned in the Theta tunnel as well. Taking much longer to find it but succeeding in the end, the three of them used the circle (the rest stayed behind to avoid teleportation and/or protect the base) and appeared in a land further west but unfamiliar to all of them. To their benefit, Gisli realized she recognized the stone upon which they stood, noting it came from (at least) the foothills of the mountains on the West coast of Mesegea! Stepping out, above ground, they were greeted by lots of rolling, grassy hills periodically broken by rocky outcroppings, like the one which their tunnel stuck out of. Heading back, the party was determined to find a path that lead to Frjósöm...</a><br>
            <a>Trying Beta tunnel next, they spent the better part of an hour looking for a shortcut to no avail. Moving onto Omicron, the last tunnel heading Directly east, they searched once more for a teleportation circle...and after nearly 40 minutes of walking down dead-ends and crawling along walls looking for cracks, Wrench and Duvu found one more circle, and teleported to the other side.</a><br>
            <a>As the darkness and pressure the party has come to associate with teleportation fades, Wrench, Duvu, and Gisli are hit with an unrelenting Heat and see sand swirling around the the rocky ground they stand on...</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="twentyone">Session TwentyOne</span></h2>
        <p>
            <a>Picking up right where we left off, Duvu, Gisli, and Wrench were standing in a Hot and Sandy tunnel having just teleported to what they believe to be Frjósöm. Quickly heading back, the Revengers decided to get an early, and good, night's rest to prepare for a "training montage"!</a><br>
            <a>Early the next day, the Hands of Hephaestus contacted Wrench to tell him that Gemma and 6 guards just got in a carriage and are preparing to leave in a westerly direction from the Paláti. Quick to head into Tropolis, the Revengers were able to get out of the city in time to see the carriage and track it from a distance.</a><br>
            <a>Gemma and her guards headed to a small, densely wooded outcropping in the middle of some fields a couple hours outside of town, stopping and entering the woods before the Revengers arrived. Sending Little A in to scout ahead, they were able to locate 4 of the guards in the woods before finding Gemma in a clearing talking to...someone. Only seeing 3 of the individuals, though feeling the presence of more, Adelvir took over Little A's senses to listen in!</a><br>
            <a>It would appear that Gemma was hiring the individuals for a hit of an...intrusive and problematic group...Jumping right into trying to handle the problem, Adelvir and Duvu sneak up to the closest guard and sync their attacks, stabbing him through his armor straight into the small of his back, sending him to a knee...and Crying out in pain!!! Still alive, he alerted everyone nearby to the attack before being quickly dispatched.</a><br>
            <a>Heading deeper into the woods, the party triggered several of these shadowy figures to attack with their poisoned blades, bringing Duvu to a painful pause in damage and Ayayron to the brink of death before Killing one of them! The battle continues as Gemma escapes in her carriage, leaving the Revengers to try and deal with these mysterious hires...that all seem to have a number of VERY familiar brass rings...6, in fact...</a><br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="twentytwo">Session TwentyTwo</span></h2>
        <p>
                    <a>With the party deep in combat, Gisli, realizing her friends were fighting for their lives and now was NOT the right time for a bathroom break, charged head first into woods drawing the attention of the remaining guard. After seeing their fatal friend fall to the ferrous familiar of the fiends fighting them, the remaining assassins fled into the woods leaving the party to demolish the poor guard abandoned by their patron.</a>
                    <a>Briefly discussing their plans, the Revengers settled down in the, now empty, woods to rest for an hour before heading back to town, knowing that the HoH would alert them if Gemma went anywhere but to the Palati. Ultimately deciding to press their luck and follow Gemma back to the Palati itself, The Revengers attempted to send Duvu, the Rogue, inside to investigate and possibly explore previously unseen rooms.</a>
                    <a>While the rest of the Revengers spent an hour playing small games, bonding, and trying to sell...recently acquired used armor, Duvu tried to put his powers of stealth to good use.</a>
                    <a>Sneaking up the servant's path, he found the back door guarded before choosing to climb up the walls and pillars themselves (due to his magical nature this was as easy as casting a spell). Seeing guards on all of the floors but no Gemma, he ultimately turned himself invisible and made his way into the Palati where he attempted many tactics to draw the guards away or distract them in some way.</a>
                    <a>Sadly for Duvu, none of his efforts worked and nearing an hour of invisibility, he opted to leap from the 3rd floor balacony, nearly 150' in the air, before landing softly as if a feather.</a>
    
                    <a>Knowing no other possible leads at the moment, the Revengers headed back to Revenger Tower to sleep and truly recover from their Brutal fight earlier that day...but after only an hour or so, Krasus sits bolt upright from his less than impressive sleep, having been yanked into consciousness by his Brand of Castigation alerting him that Plequa,</a>
                    <h3>the Man in Purple,<br>
                    the Master of Coin for the Eleusian Mysteries,<br>
                    and one of The Council of 7,<br></h3>
                    <a>is no longer on Frjósöm...</a>
                    <h2>Hes in Tropolis!!!</h2>
            </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="twentythree">Session TwentyThree</span></h2>
        <p>
            <a>Despite being shaken awake by Krasus, who whispered "the boy is back in town" as he did so, <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#all" id="all-ref">The Revengers all</a> awoke surprisingly refreshed, with a fading, odd warmth they can only attribute to the times they've been in the presence of the Gods. He quickly informed them of his Brand of Castigation's sudden alert and they wasted no time, heading straight for the basement and to the teleportation circle to town.</a><br>
        </p><p>
            <a>Leading the way, Krasus quickly headed from the inner circle of old tropolis to the NorthWest, to the Upper district, where the rich-folk typically live. As they walked through the well lit night, Duvu then Krasus and finally Adelvir all noticed a figure that they seem to be unintentionally following. Generally shaped like an adult male elf, the figure kept a hood pulled low and had a sizable leather bag thrown over a shoulder and seemed to be making the same turns as the party, about 90 feet ahead. As they rapidly approached their destination, according to Krasus, the three of them attempted to draw the figure's attention and learn more about them. but he slipped inside a decent sized home nestled between two ostentatious mansions crammed into a city before the party could do too much. Not to be ditched, The Revengers chased the figure into the building as that was their destination too!</a><br>
        </p><p>
            <a>Stepping into the foyer, Krasus offered "You there!" as their eyes adjusted to the relatively dim light indoors and saw the elf looking back in surprise and another figure behind him came into view. Wrench, Adelvir, and Ayayron recognized the elf as Katar Adquinal, Head servant to the Peokias family. And <u>none</u> of you recognized the tall, half-orc man with light gray skin and sizable tusks that almost reach his flat, wide nose with a faintly-green glowing rapier in his right hand. Though, Krasus' brand magic told him this was still Plequa!</a><br>
        </p><p>
            <a>Diving immediately into combat with a holler <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#quote" id="quote-ref">"Just stand down and we will stop fighting"</a>, Gisli charged straight in, immediately killed Katar and sprinted closer to Plequa. After several minutes of grueling combat, Plequa and Duvu both laid bloodied, beaten, and broken on the ground.....<br>Duvu, however, was healed a few moments later. As Wrench's trident plunged into Plequa's sizable half-orc body, which then collapsed to the ground, it faded and morphed into a smaller (though still ded), pale man that reminds you of his first face that you saw (at the party) though with a few features more exaggerated now (larger nose, wider mouth, bigger/bulgier eyes).</a><br>
        </p><p>
            <a>To tie off the night, Krasus opened the bag that Katar brought here secretly at nearly midnight, the bag that Plequa, even while in battle, tried to save...finding what the party has good reason to believe is a set of golden, _ornamental_ plate armor, à la:<br>
            <a  href="#link" id="armor-ref" aria-describedby="footnote-label"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='Golden_Armor.png') }}" alt="Peokias Ornamental Armor" width="500" height="auto" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='Golden_Armor.png') }}"></a>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2><span id="twentyfour">Session TwentyFour</span></h2>
        <p>
            <a>As we rejoin the party, they stand over the golden armor spread on the table and the bodies of Plequa and Katar on the floor. Frail and small as both are, they fit in the leather bag Katar brought making it very easy to keep an eye on them till departure.</a>
        </p><p>
            <a>The Revengers explored the rest of the home, finding a mostly un-lived in home. Clearly, Plequa preferred to spend time elsewhere...They also found a few other items on Plequa himself and around the master bedroom's desk and nightstands:</a><br>
            <ul>
                <li>4 daggers</li>
                <li>1 set of quality leather armor</li>
                <li>1 small black cipher, written in <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#lang" id="lang-ref">unknown language</a></li>
                <li>1 small <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#journal" id="journal-ref">journal</a></li>
                <li>1 ledger, written in the same unknown language as the cipher</li>
            </ul>
        </p><p>
            <a>Heading back to Revenger Tower, the party asked Ja'ar Visro if he could read the language. To their luck he could and would successfully translate it, as well even use the cipher to interpret the ledger completely. Browsing through it, Wrench saw nothing but numbers...thankfully Duvu was also looking and started to notice small discrepancies...Tiny ones...and recognizing vendor names from the market...</a><br>
            <h3>Plequa was stealing from the Trading Guild!<br>
                Copper Pieces off of a few transactions per vendor a year for over 30 years!!!<br>
                This is how he fills the coffers for Udgred and the Eleusian Mysteries!!!</h3><br>
        </p><p>
            <a>As they finished receiving this information and requesting Ja'ar duplicate his efforts, Wrench heard word that Gemma was on the move...first to Plequa's home and then quickly off to the merchant district before settling down inside a building. Taking off in pursuit, the party not only manages to find the building but work their way Into the room. Before the Guild Board Meeting they know is about to begin can get underway, Gisli is able to meet to stout Stark-Black haired dwarven men that greeted her kindly.</a>
        </p><p>
            <a>As Gemma calls the room to order, she falls silent at the sight of Wrench, before regaining her composure and confronting the party in front of everyone. After a bit of a back and forth, she convinces the party to wait outside while the private board meeting convenes and <b>THEN</b> she will happily, and in front of the rest of the board if they so choose, talk with the Revengers.</a>
        </p><p>
            <a>Following a thorough conversation ranging from Plequa's thievery for decades (including FROM Gemma) to Her apparent lack of knowledge of Udgred over to her surprise at the news that her family ceremonial armor had been stolen and what she knew about it. Wrapping up the conversation, Krasus outright announced to the room that Gemma had hired assassins to kill them but they understand, just call them off...oh, and The Revengers (them) killed Plequa! Gemma also promised to send word if she recalls any information that her reflection on her friendship with Plequa may reveal.</a>
        </p><p>
            <a>Moving quickly, The Revengers met with Izin to see how he was doing, only to be greeted by their weepy eyed friend happy to see them alive knowing the bounty was just called off from their heads and they <i>"survived Hands, thank Goodness the Masters weren't hired! Though...that Would be out of the usual for the organization that hired them."</i> he also confirmed that all is well, the relationship with the Clippers is fine, <i>"its just money, surely you understand?"</i></a><br>
        </p><p>
            <a>Thinking onto their next task, The Revengers reflect on info they had:
            <ul>
                <li>Udgred is planning to do something in just under <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#timeline" id="timeline-ref">3 weeks time</a> to finish his plot using Demeter somehow.</li>
                <li>Udgred has 3 Generals, <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#councilof7" id="councilof7-ref">The Council of 7</a>: <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#kinstus" id="kinstus-ref">Kinstus</a>, <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#plequa" id="plequa-ref">Plequa</a>, and <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#briggox" id="briggox-ref">Briggox</a>.</li>
                <li>They've now killed and removed Plequa from the playing field.</li>
                <li>They killed and rekilled Kinstus, though last they knew, someone had taken his body Back to Frjósöm where the EM's HQ is.</li>
                <li>They've never seen or encountered Briggox, as far as they know.</li>
            </ul>
        </p><p>
            <a>Hoping to continue their work of whittling down Udgred's support, they sought Persephone's help to find Briggox. Beseeching her in her temple, they were lead to a private room and spoke with the goddess herself. She Confirmed the reception of Plequa's soul and the Loss of Kinstus' and that she would try to use some of her favors to ask the other gods about Briggox but could make no promises as she is not always the most beloved by her Olympic peers.</a>
        </p><p>
            <a>By a stroke of ... something, Wrench and Gisli suggested that possibly Ares would help the god-employed party locate this "great warrior", Briggox, and maybe some sentimental connection to lost warriors (of Gisli's past). Only to find a frat house of meat head worshipers that sacrifice lambs at the foot of Ares' statue and break out into reverential roars of joy at any sign of the divine. Wrench pleaded with Ares to help them locate this warrior to help keep the status quo as they feel Udgred's upset would remove all possibility of war. To everyone but Wrench, nothing seemed to change as he prayed before hurling the sheep, but the instant it splattered against the wall, the Giant statue of Ares turned to look at Wrench and spat <b><i>"And why would I want to stop the greatest war of all time?"</i></b></a>

        <p>
            <a>After Adelvir rejoins the party outside of the Temple to Ares, they learn that Gemma went public and told everyone what the Revengers did for the trading guild, triggering a lot of job offers for the team.</a><br>
            <a>The Revengers are then whisked away to another universe where the norse gods, known as the Aesir, rule instead of the Greek Gods we've come to know and love on Eturn.</a><br>
            <a>These gods are in trouble, as their prophetic story of Ragnarok, a cyclical event that ends and restarts their universe, is underway.</a><br>
            <a>Many of their gods are already dead and the events are almost done, but the prophecy will not come to fruition unless the last remaining humans, Lif and Lifthrasir, are found and brought back to these remaining gods.</a><br>

            <a>Finding a secret portal in the room with the Aesir, The Revengers headed off after Freya (another Goddess) as she was the last to see the humans. Taking them to Folkvang, which appeared to be a land of the dead, Ferya was able to send them to the same land as the humans, though warned them against Sinmara, a demon of dreams, shadows, and nightmares.</a><br>
            <a>In this, yet another, new land, the Revengers see magic that guided them to a cave where the Humans were hiding. Sinmara did find them, however, and attempted to kill these saviors And the last Humans!</a>

            <a>Finally returning to their own universe, the Revengers headed back to their tower for a well earned rest, only staying awake long enough to find out from Ja'ar Visro that it is now the end of Wednesday, and he hadn't seen them since they left for town Tuesday morning...</a>

            <a>The party then split into separate groups! The <i>"Sneak Squad"</i> was Adelvir, Duvu, and Krasus, Ayayron left on his own to explore and scout ahead, and The <i>"Distraction Division"</i> was Gisli and Wrench!</a><br>
            <ol>
                <li>The "Sneak Squad" picked the lock on the back gate and went inside the house using the door there. Dodging an Iris Camera, they then moved on to explore the Dining room, Lounge area, and Kitchen all on the West side of the first floor.</li>
                <li>The "Distraction Division" waited a few minutes after everyone else, as previously agreed, before heading into the pool area, where they saw an un-explored poolhouse. Finding a hidden ladder there, they descended while invisible only to find themselves in a security room. They quickly handled the 4 guards (1 Red Dragonborn, 1 Blue Dragonborn, 1 slender and young looking elf, and 1 towering half-orc) there and saw the 4 live Iris Cameras used to watch the home.</li>
                <li>Ayayron, off on his own, used his Potion of Gaseous Form and flew up into a cracked window on the 3rd floor. He used this opportunity to explore the entirety of the 3rd floor, quietly sneaking into and out of various Offices and bedrooms.</li>

            <a>The Distraction Division explored the basement super thoroughly finding a boardroom (with video conferencing magic), Master workshop with a really nice set of diamond tools and a teleportation circle, a Giant safe, and a workshop with more diamond tools and a diamond pickaxe.</a>
            <a>Using the ladder also in the workshop, Wrench and Gisli added Ayayron to the Distraction Division and had him Also try to break into the safe, to no avail.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a>Continuing their exploration of the first floor, the Sneak Squad quietly made their way into a large library with floor to ceiling bookshelves on 3 walls, a billiards table, 6 fluffy chairs, and a large stairwell leading up to the second floor.</a>
            <a>Finding a few books of interest, Krasus grabbed three scruffy looking, well-loved and used books from the shelves:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refining with Mesegea</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extremely well-worn pages discuss the <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#SoT" id="SoT-ref"><i>Sea of Tropolis</i></a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Grinders, Polishers, Drill Bits & More!</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Largely about the various tools used in refining gems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The Big ol' Book o' Rocks</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Largely about the various methods for extracting gems from Eturn.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </a>
            <a>Putting those in his bag, Duvu and Krasus both heard the footsteps of a guard and so lept into action. Duvu jumping to <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#hide" id="hide-ref">hide</a> while Krasus grabbed Adelvir and pulled him into the dark corner, yelling to draw the guard faster as a trick.</a>
            <a>Taking advantage of his arcane blood magics, Krasus was able to momentarily restrain this first guard, and then a second that decended after the first yelled for help. He and Adelvir took that time to tie them up and then move on to the upstairs, primarily taking the time to explore the hallway with its <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#desks" id="desks-ref">desks</a>, and stepping out onto the Patios!

        <h2><span id="twentynine">Session TwentyNine</span></h2>
        <p>
            <a>With the help of Ayayron, the Distraction Division was able to get into the safe in the basement, finding Quite a lot.</a>
            <a>Grabbing what they could carry, they teleported up to the lobby to await the morning.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a>While the first half gathered belongings from the safe, the unknowing Sneak Squad continued to explore the second floor, finding a door (to what turned out to be a closet) that teleported them across the floor to another room!</a>\
            <a>After breaking the wall to find out what was in the room behind the magic door, they continued to explore that floor and found the secret tunnel the rest of the team found in the linen closet.</a>
            <a>Taking that as a sign that the Distraction Division had already been there, they opted to go downstairs and either wait out the night, or find the rest of the party, Only to discover their friends sitting calmly in the lobby with a lot of gold and artifacts.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a>As security had been totally handled, the Revengers were able to wait for the Sapphireshapers to decend in the morning.</a>
            <a>Bramwikara, the head of household they interacted with before, invited them to the breakfast that the family Would be eating before they handled business, with most of the party accepting.</a>
            <a>Finally, she asked for them to list off everything they took:
                <ul>
                    <li>20 (older) patents from the safe</li>
                    <li>A diamond pickaxe</li>
                    <li>3 <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#deeds" id="deeds-ref">deeds</a></li>
                    <li>~$121,000 worth of gold and platinum</li>
                    <li>10 additional newer patents</li>
                    <li>3 older and frequently used books</li>
                    <li>a glass of scotch</li>
                    <li>a set of VERY high quality sheets</li>
                    <li>2 halves of the safe key</li>
                    <li>a gorgeous sapphire jewled necklace and matching earrings</li>
                    <li>the notebook from the elder dwarf's nightstand</li>
                    <li>a mason jar with something that resembles truffles or mushrooms</li>
                    <li>Fancy dark salt in a grinder</li>
                    <li>a pen and a couple notebooks from the entryway</li>
                </ul>
            </a>
            <a>Taking thorough notes on everything they presented, Bramwikara indicated she needed to discuss with her brother, Buncliv, the treasurer, in order to determine their payment, but she would be back shortly.</a>
