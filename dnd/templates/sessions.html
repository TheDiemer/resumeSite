	    Presented <a href='/dnd/backstory'>the backstory</a>, the <a href='/dnd/character'>character creation details</a>, and some of the <a href='/dnd/setting'>setting details</a>!</p>

	<h2><span id="one">Session One</span></h2>
	<p>
	    <a href='/dnd/party'>The gang</a>a> was deposited at the castle, told to <i>"explore the whole thing and light a fire within view of the village for rescue"</i>.<br>
	    Solved a puzzle in the fountain to open the door.<br>
	    Explored 4 rooms, 3 stairwells, and a hidden hallway on the ground floor.<br>
	    The basement contained a prison as well as a hidden portal that reset the players to when they first entered the castle.<br>
	    And the second floor contained 8 bedrooms, with 3 portals to a mystical version of the bedrooms, two with monsters and the third contained <a href="/dnd/party#akta">a Tiefling friend!</a><br>
	</p>

	<br>
	<h2><span id="two">Session Two</span></h2>
	<p>
	    <a href='/dnd/party'>The gang</a> decided to headup one of the main spiral staircases (rather than our Hidden set they used to get here).<br>
	    As they climbed, everyone felt a very odd sensation, though could not identify anything wrong, and finished the climb to the next floor.<br>
	    Here they found a similar layout as the last floor, just with offices instead of bedrooms!<br>
	    Here they found portals, that lead them to more fights and some silver, as well as a journal that told them the inhabitants were from 200 years prior.<br>
	    After finishing that floor, they climbed the grand staircase to the Throne Room!<br>
	    They had a...less than helpful conversation with a Kenku named Yordar and then proceeded to kill his kobold soldiers before lighting a fire in the window and heading back down to await pickup!<br>

	<h2><span if="three">Session Three</span></h2>
	<p>
		<a href='/dnd/party'>Our adventurers</a> lit the required fire in late evening and rested the night away before being collected by Uzul in the morning.<br>
		He informed them that news had ALREADY spread of their success and adventure with requests coming in for heros! They set off immediately!<br>
		They headed to Elytos, where the local University's all centaur frat, ΗΟΡΣE, need help cleaning their toilet(basement) and the party decided to leave for Demaphos instead.<br>
		Demaphos had need of catching a lion, which they visited the cave of after meeting Lieutenant Daniel Pickles.<br>
		The party got split in a maze inside the cave and the Lion attacked!!!<br>
		After killing the lion, it was revealed that Lt. Pickles was a Werelion who worked his way into the Police Force to stay secret!<br>
		The Party collected the payment (637 gp) from the Captain and headed home to Hose!<br>

	<h2><span id="four">Session Four</span></h2>
	<p>
		This was our PC Intro session!<br>
		We roleplayed the road to Elytos! There were 2 days of uninterrupted horseback riding.<br>
		Our players introduced themselves, <a href="/dnd/party">giving a brief bit of info about themselves</a> before moving on to asking questions, learning about each other, and just roleplaying together!
	</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<h2><span id="five">Session Five</span></h2>
	<p>
		<a href="/dnd/party">Our wacky crew of adventurers</a> were instructed to give the horses a rest before heading off on their next heroic quest -- To Help the Mad Cows of Philonia, before their Festival of Phaethusa!<br>
		On the road they fought, and killed, two owlbear cubs but with no mother in sight, the party rested up and continued on to Philonia, arriving the morning Of the Festival!<br>
		Wasting no time at all the party investigated the cows and their field and saw just how mad they were - Wrench got bit on the hand trying to heal one!<br>
		They saw that the local Hat Factory (which provides fanciful, and slightly magic, hats to the Hattery In Town) was upstream from the main water source for the cows and thought they should investigate the Hattery and then the Factory as well.<br>
		Pissed off the Hatter (Todd) but <a href="/dnd/party#duvu">Duvu</a> stole a Violently Purple Top Hat fitted Perfectly to <a href="/dnd/party#adelvir">Adelvir</a>, before they were kicked out of course!<br>
		At the factory, they stood a better chance, as <a href="/dnd/party#akta">Akta</a> was able to charm the floor manager, Polo Fleetfoot, into showing them the main factory floor -- AND the restricted section where they have their R&D department!<br>
		Upstairs in R&D, they met a Half-orc Wizard named Gerta who informed them of the weather proofing potion and its Maddening side effects!!!<br>
		Akta, having charmed him still, was able to learn from Polo that the factory simply washed away the leftover potion and dumped it into the stream every night, thereby discovering the exact cause of the Mad Cows!<br>
		Adelvir had already taken it upon himself to flirt up a storm with Gerta and managed to convince her to give them the antidote for free to fix the cows, figure out a safer way to magically weather-proof the hats, AND sleep with him!<br>
		As thanks for discovering this, and fixing it, the Mayor of Philonia provided them his sigil, informing them that they need only show that to any vendor tonight at the festival and they would be paid for!<br>
		As the final thanks, the Wonderful Organizer of the Festival, Alyssa, encouraged them to stay for the Festival and provided them the 300 gold pieces that she, the ranchers, and others in the village were able to scrape together as thanks!<br>
