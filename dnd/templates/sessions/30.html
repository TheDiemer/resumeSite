        <p>
            <a>The Revengers discussed the options Bramwikara offered and made their choices of money, objects, or promises of objects and went on their way.</a>
            <a>Taking a moment at home to eat up and talk with Ja'ar Visro, the Revengers quizzed him on the Sapphireshaper family, not learning too terribly much other than longevity.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a>Quickly turning around and heading straight back into town, the party set out with <b><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#goals" id="goals-ref">3 Goals</a></b> in mind.</a>
            <a>Hephaestus spoke with the party through the forge, promising to help however he can and confirming that Briggox appears to be on Frjósöm most of the time.</a>
            <a>In the market, Ayayron bought more of the potions used for sneaking and Krasus bought tree sap and bee's wax from "Gasula's Apothecary and More".</a>
            <a>As they approach the address from the job, they see a small, dark grey harengon with shockingly green eyes playing with a small grey cap standing in front of a dilapidated one-story townhome, nestled between two similarly rundown looking building fronts.</a>
