            Heading to the temple to Apollo to quickly get to the Cascade Circle, the Revengers easily found their way to the secret tunnels underground.<br>
            The young gnome attendent, Amara, tipped you off that the door doesn't always lead to the Labrynth of Dawnrise and that the door cares about your intention...<i>so focus on the Cascade Circle</i>.<br>
            Watching the door seemingly rotate down and out of view, a much more impressive and elegant door slammed into place, and immediately opened to the Leonin figure of Irune that the party quickly recognizes!<br>

            Diving directly into the dark discussions, the Cascade Circle had the Revengers share their knowledge of Udgred, the Eleusian Mysteries, Ragnarok (this one was a fun mind reading), and the impending sacrifice of Demeter.<br>
            After noting that the visions Lura saw in Adelvir's mind of Ragnarok terrified her as it showed another universe where a version of Udgred brought about the start of Ragnarok, ending that cycle of power.<br>
            Casting a major image to share the story, Nenbi of the Circle recounted the story of <i>a younger, hulking black-scaled dragonborn named Udgred that came to the Circle some 50 years ago.<br>
            Udgred begged the Circle to tutor him and allow him to join them as a master of Necromancy, but, in a divided vote, they chose to reject him.</i><br>

            Using this oversight as a bit of leverage, Adelvir convinced the Circle to act and help them with the oncoming battle, to which they discussed and agreed to help the Revengers (and their platoon) with the exterior attack.<br>
            Krasus questioned their usefulness in a battle and Irune sent a massive fireball off into the darkness surrounding the Circle which exploded in the distance with impressive heat and light, momentarily blinding the party and reminding them of their mountain explosion...<br>
            In a final plea for more info or something to help, The Cascade Circle shared rumors and legends of a magic lyre, thought to be last owned by a former noble in the royal family.<br>
            The stories of the lyre suggest some mystical powers over the dead and they recommended that the Revengers look into this lyre, starting at the Palace.<br>

            Taking the Circle's advice, the Revengers headed to the palace, where instead of finding their usual 2 elven guards that reach ouot to the Oracle, they found a stout dwarven man standing in front of the door off Diemer Boulevarde.<br>
            As the party approached, they saw this man's large rosy cheeks and impressive, but kinda laughable, mustache, curled and sticking out beyond the edges of his face.<br>
            Perthy Zo, as he introduced himself, spoke with a thick lisp and refused them entry!<br>
            <br>
            That is until Alden, who happened to be walking by, swooped in and vouched for the Revengers, welcoming them into the palace!<br>
            Jumping right into conversation with the Revengers, Alden asked what brought them here and was ecstactic to learn they were on a quest, noting that was her mission too...a quest...that she left vague for now as she led you down a hallway towards her workshop!<br>
