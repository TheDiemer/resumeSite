            Dealing with an extremely diverse crowd and slowly letting everyone in, The Revengers began asking the incoming patrons about The Serpent Riders and to their luck a durante of Toucan Aarakocra actually pointed them towards a large grouping of graffiti!<br>
            Spliting the party even further, Krasus and Adelvir left the front in the hands of Duvu and Ayayron and headed down the street that the aarakocra had indicated.<br>
            Wrench kept a silent eye, Gisli enjoyed good stories, and Duvu and Ayayron left the line to anguish while Krasus and Adelvir triangulated the HQ for The Serpent Riders and managed to sneak inside!

        <a>
            With some quick thinking and logically applied threats, they convince the first kobold they meet to go fetch their leader, Chad.<br>
            A tall and overly muscular golden dragonborn ascends the stairs from the basement, where loud chants of "Ser Pent Ri Ders" can be heard over loud alt-rock/country music, and owns the name of Chad.<br>
            The ensuing conversation goes poorly and leads Adelvir to polymorphing Chad into a small mouse, inspite of an attempted counterspell!<br>
            The Duo's threats land much harder with the initial kobold because of this impressive display of magic and Krasus' suggestion to start a rival tavern doesn't fall on deaf ears either!<br>
            Having summoned the whole party, they must all now walk back together to finish their duty as bouncers, where everyone managed to end at least a little happier, with 200 more gold in the collective pockets and their stomach's full of Crepe Castle's sugary delights, and Adelvir managed to give away a look to a welcoming loxodon.

            The only remaining work for the night, at 3 am, was for Wrench to send a message to the Cascade Circle! He hopes to talk about their current predicament and what they can do about it.

            Finally getting rest at home, the (majority of the) party gets a long rest until they are reawoken to the smell of fresh coffee by Ja'ar Visro in the middle of the day!<br>
            Along with delicious coffee and his usual breakfast offerings, Ja'ar Visro brings news, the Sapphireshapers have finished collecting their payments and are ready to see the Revengers!<br>
            Having already received his payment, Ayayron volunteered to stay behind, wanting to learn from his necromancer instead anyway!<br>
            Adelvir, stumbling back into the basement as the rest of the pary headed downstairs to leave, also opted to stay home. Having also been paid already, Adelvir was happy to sleep instead of go another city block.<br>
            Leaving Wrench, Duvu, Gisli, and Krasus to meet with Bramwikara and accept their final payment.<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            Happy to see them, Bramwikara ran upstairs to get their payments and returned with:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>a Ring of Protection for Duvu,</li>
                <li>a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4942-ioun-stone-of-strength">Stone of Athena</a>for Gisli,</a></li>
                <li>a Ring of Protection for Krasus as well,</li>
                <li>and a Belt of Dwarvenkind for Wrench, with a custom engraved belt buckle</li>
            </ul><br>
            And out on the street in front of the Sapphireshaper family home is where we left the majority of our party!
