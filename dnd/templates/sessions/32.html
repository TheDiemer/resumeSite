                After briefly chasing and losing Flint, Krasus joined the party in the basement before they all returned upstairs and found a <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#bl" id="bl-ref">letter from Briggox!</a><br>
                The letter told them that the Eleusian Mysteries is keeping up with them well, including their attempt to run Getra via Smimdap and Witha!<br>
                Briggox told them he has their "friends" at the nearby abandoned Demopeion Colosseum!!!<br>

                before also heading back to the Tower for rest, they hired 2 Hands of Hephaestus to go scout ahead, smartly knowing that information is power!<br>
