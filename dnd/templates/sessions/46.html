            Using the symbol of the Labyrinth of Dawnrise as sufficient justification to head to the entrance, The Revengers, plus Alden, quickly left the palace!
            In the presence of the Lyre, the Entrance to the Labyrinth changed completely, showing a brand new entrance to a totally different Labyrinth!
            Though clearly magical and coming from an unkown source, the party headed into the maze designed for them

            Charging headfirst into a series of dead-ends, turnbacks, and rooms, The Party fought their way through a pack of Hell Hounds and an ethereal set of ghosts before stumbling into a room of Sword Spiders!
