                With a report of 8 normal looking humanoids and ~25 zombies at the colosseum, The Revengers knew they wanted to hire big time assassins and headed back to the Merchant's Guild.<br>
                Finding they onl had to wait for her arrival, they briefly met with Gemma to ask for money, and left with 800 pp!<br>
                Taking that money directly to the Cutter's Guild, they hired 7 Hands for 700 pp per day.<br>

            <a>
                Leaving for the colosseum immediately, The Revengers, Ayayron's zombie, and 7 Hands arrived not too far after sunset.<br>
                Sending the Hands upstairs to handle anyone they find there, The Revengers and Zombie head around the interior of the ring around the fighting pit, only finding some rubble that blocked the end.<br>

            <a>
                Discovering it was no rubble, the party lept into action and quickly killed the Necromancer that generated it and prepared themselves for a fight to remember...<br>
