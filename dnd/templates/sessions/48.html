            Continuing to explore the dark, The Revengers found their way through a set of tunnels leading them deeper into the underworld.

            Our party managed to figure out a small sign in the crossroads that seemed to show what the paths led to, something they hadn't yet found!
            As they like to...check for anything left behind, the party stormed to the barracks and found a set of fiends still living in this portion of the Labyrinth!

            After another set of battles, this time drawing a lot of blood from both groups, The Revengers stood tall and a little bruised, ready to continue on!
