            Stepping out of the Palace and into a fresh Monday Morning, and led by the nearly cantankerous Gisli, The Revengers reviewed their pending tasks and queries:
            <ul>
                <li>The Sapphireshapers are working on collecting payment still.</li>
                <li>The King and his Royal Court are aware of Udgred and are building a Platoon to help.</li>
                <li>Several local jobs left pending as Iris Messages.</li>
                <li>A Job from Rizzo that will take ~2 weeks.</li>
                <li>Persephone predicted her Mother plans to do something with Udgred on the coming Solstice in 11 days.</li>
            </ul><br>
            And opted to continue to develop their local reputation, choosing to work jobs around Tropolis as a way to wait out some time.<br>

            Thinking a fair amount of Drinking will come with it, the party chooses to help out the local Official Tavern of Dionysus, <b>The Manic Panther</b>.<br>
            Finding a loud party happening in the middle of the morning, The Revengers find and meet with their Patron, a very pretty elf by the name of Liluth Omarel.<br>
            It turns out Liluth is taking some initiative, hoping to gain positive attention from the Owner so she can be promoted to Manager over the current <i>idiot,</i> Olo Goodchild, a halfling she describes as utterly useless.<br>
            She is hiring you as bodyguards for a night or two, specifically to keep out and scare off a small gang of Dionysus followers who believe the bar is misrepresenting Dionysus...but choosing to express that through drunken acts of violence IN The Manic Panther.<br>

            The group is primarily a group of adolescent Kobolds who can be identified by hissing, their <a ariad-describedby="footnote-label" href="#TSR-Symbol" id="TSR-Symbol-ref">symbol</a> (which they are known to blast on walls as graffiti using <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/color-spray">color spray</a>), and saying their group name: <a ariad-describedby="footnote-label" href="#TSR" id="TSR-ref">The Serpent Riders!</a><br>
            Oh, and they end up pretty angry once they are in the tavern, so angry people might be a clue too!<br>

            Setting Wrench up at the back of the bar, the rest of the party took up shop out front of the bar and began to bounce!<br>
            Quickly establishing a required phrase "Sally sells sea shells down by the sea shore" and found a few kobold trying to sneak in!<br>
            Adelvir managed to trip them up and scared the leader of this grouping and then went right back to testing people with their phrase for several hours!<br>
            Having already let the rest of those kobold's friends inside, Krasus chased them down, asked them some more probing questions, and warned Wrench to keep an eye on them.<br>
            Gisli also found her way inside the tavern for a time, as she shared battle stories with a dwarf that came through the line.
