    <p>
        Continuing the positive momentum they had begun to build in the fight against these 6 fiends, The Revengers walloped the remaining 3 before nearly collapsing from exhaustion!<br>
        They managed to maintain consciousness long enough to make sure Wrench was comfortable watching as he recharged and to ensure Alden made it into the room.<br>
        Though not attacked in their sleep, the party did get pushed out of the room in the night, with everyone waking quickly enough to escape unharmed...other than poor Alden who briefly experienced a broken arm, before Adelvir healed her up.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking the rude awakening in stride, the party started their day immediately, heading in the direction of the "fancy chair" indicated on the small crossroads indicator they found previously.<br>
        Being careful to not stumble into more enemies or traps, Krasus snuck forward til he began to see another room.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Pausing to see as far as he could and see what detail he could make out from the large entrance to the large room, he saw
        a long, wide, and tall corridor with 12 artfully decorated columns set in the walls reaching from the dark floors up to the black ceiling, 50 feet above your heads.<br>
        At this distance, the only details Krasus is able to make out are the closest column's art depicting the story of Prometheus bringing fire to mortals, though in this artwork he produces the fire on his own, instead of stealing it from the Gods, and a small mark on the floor, most of the way to the impressively large doors on the other side.<br> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sending Duvu in, to be EXTRA safe and check for traps, was quickly confirmed to be the right choice, as even with his highly tuned senses, Duvu stumbles right across a Glyph of Warding!<br>
        Thanks to his past experiences with magical traps, Duvu felt the tell-tale warmth under his feet <b>just in time</b>, leaping behind the nearest pillar (depecting Demeter casting Plant Growth over different plots of land to enrich them and teach mortals about Agriculture) to fully avoid the massive Fireball that exploded from the exact spot he stood only moments before!<br>
        With the danger out of the way, Duvu examind the spot on the floor only to see it read <i>"Made ya look!"</i>, which is annoying, but also meant the Party felt safe to explore further.<br>
        Krasus took his time appreciating the art, though many of the columns depicted sources of magical stories he did not recognize immediately, the other one that stood out was of Zeus clearly casting lightning bolt in the Gods' fight against the Titans.<br>
        To leave this slightly singed room, Gisli knocks on the large doors, which ring loudly as if metal, and despite the silence so often met in this maze, a loud, soft and muffled woman's voice rang out "Enter!"<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the next hallway into what was clearly a dark, obsidian throne room, The Revengers were quickly greeted by Hecate!<br>
        The Goddess of Magic and Crossroads took the time to complement The Revengers on passing her tests! Telling them that the strings contain the real power behind this magic, which is why SHE safeguarded it, she also quickly handed them over, not needing to beat around the bush for those having already succeeded!<br>
        Upon request, she provided a teleportation circle for the party to take back up to the streets of Tropolis and wished them luck in defeating Udgred!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Alden quickly checked in that she really had just experienced everything that happend and went on her way back to the palace, leaving The Revengers standing in the street feeling rested, empowered, stressed, stronger, prepared, and clueless but the Solstice approaches...
