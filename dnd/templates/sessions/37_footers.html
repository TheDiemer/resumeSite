<li id="TOOT">Everyone in the party would have at least heard of some of the prophecies from the current Oracle, if not having heard the Herald proclaim one directly.

<li id="Proph1"><a id="prophecy">Broken chains upon the floor breaks the peace forevermore, But sins of the father, left unpunished, keep the realm from being tarnished, One must carry family debt, lest he face a bigger threat, For from the bones and twisted spire comes the most wicked, wretched fire.</a>.<a href="#Proph1-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↵</a></li>
<li id="Icarius">The Former King was a tyrant that played favorites with his city-state before his son, the current King Arsenios, declared war, tearing the kingdom in two. The Third Great War, or The War of Icarius, was a vicious and bloody civil war that eventually led to the kingdom finding peace under King Arsenios. It was not formerly known that he was alive, he simply disappeared after he publicly signed the treaty.<a href="#Icarius-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↵</a></li>
