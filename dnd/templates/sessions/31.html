    <h2><span id="thirtyone">Session Thirty One</span></h2>
        <p>
            <a>Running headfirst into the home, Duvu lead the charge of everyone except Krasus, sneakily, and quickly found the noise emanating from a hole in the floor beneath the bookshelf in the bedroom.</a>
            <a>After much struggle and noise, they moved the bookshelf and descended down a long and pitch black stairwell.</a>
            <a>Pausing only to dispatch a gelatinous cube that tried to catch them from behind, The Revengers headed into the only room at the bottom of the stairs and found the source of the noise:<br>
            A Large Undead Minotaur smashing his axe into the stone floor!!!</a>
        </p>
        <p>Diving straight into combat, the Revengers demolished the minotaur AND his 9 zombie friends, leaving themselves, and a zombie under Ayayron's control, as the only things still standing.</p>
