            While the Oracle and her accompanying team wait in the other room, The Revengers briefly discuss wanting to take the job and not necessarily tell the king everything.<br>
            Calling them back into the waiting room, The party dicusses payment and how the jailbreak happened.<br>
            Quickly pointing them towards the jail cell that Icarius was being held in previously, where they would be free to investigate and talk with the guards that were on duty, The Oracle directed Burt to lead them there.<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            Heading down a dizzying amount of hallways, turns, forks, and doorways, eventually Burt lead the party down to the dungeon where they are greeted by a 6' 8" gray-skinned orc that runs the prison.<br>
            Taking a few moments to collect all of their weapons, inform them about the bar around the corner that does swing dancing on Saturday nights (via natural conversation), and warning the magic users to mind themselves, Orakh took the party deeper into the prison.<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            Passing a multitude of closed cell doors and hallways leading to more, they eventually found their way to a door protected by 2 guards where Orakh told them they had arrived.<br>
            With a flick of magic to his eyes, Adelvir quickly spotted part of the stairs that, upon further investigation and conversation with the guards down the stairs, appear to be the only thing out of place.<br>
            Thanks to his experience breaking into and out of various magical and ordinary places, Ayayron quickly found the magic to interact with the stairs and triggered it, revealing a Massive tunnel leading off into the darkness!<br>

        <a>
            Heading into the darkness, the party found themselves near the Pal√°ti Peokias, in fact, found themselves right beneath its rock wall, as the tunnel deposited them next to the bazaar established here.<br>
            Thinking on his feet, Wrench headed over to visit his warforged friend, D.A.D.E., asking if there was anything he might've seen the night before.<br>
            Much to the delight of the party, D.A.D.E didn't recall any large group that looked weird, but he DID remember a hooded figure keeping to themselves before heading North!<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            Turning to ask the party "What's North?", Wrench had his answer from Krasus before they could even finish asking, "Eroy. Eroy is to the North..."<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            Finally, The Revengers found a merchant selling a wagon, hitched up to Wrench's warhorse and set off to begin the 2 day treck to Eroy!
