            Clearly convincing the former king of their allegiance, The Revengers were offered to join the toast being prepared!<br>
            With Krasus outside, Duvu having sneaky enough hands and weary enough eyes, and Wrench being...well, Wrench... Gisli, Adelvir, and Ayayron were the only party members to actually drink to the former king.<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            And a good thing at that, as clearly the drink was poisoned!!!

        <a>
            As the only (conscious) party member upstairs for the toast, Wrench was the only one to see the the human that served the drinks grab a small vial from his pocket and drain it as he, and everyone that drank, collapses to the ground!

            Wrench was able to wake Adelvir and after some time, the human, named Garfire Qinran, awoke on his own.<br>
            Trying to understand what happened better, revealed Garfire to be a New Kingsmen sympathizer (if not former member) who merely Lept at an opportunity to kill the former King when he saw it.<br>
            Offering him safety for himself and his daughter, The Revengers gave him 2 gp and a healing potion with instructions to message them once he and his daughter arrive at Tropolis.<br>

        Taking a moment on their way out of town, they informed the town's Mayor that there are people that will be meeting at Hermannus' barn soon that were looking to commit treason against King Arsenios.<br>
        Heading first to the Tower, they put Icarius into a "prison cell" (a toilet in the basement) and held him overnight as they rested and recovered.<br>
        Awoken in the night by Icarius' yelling, the Revengers dealt with him and eventually had Ja'ar Visro tie him up (using magic) and then headed off to the Palace!<br>

        <a>
            The Oracle was over the moon to see them, spending a few moments taking measurements for everyone to have nice robes, she then sent the whole team+Icarius and Burt, off to return Icarius to his prison cell under Orakh's care.<br>
