            Heading North to Eroy directly from the bazaar, The Revengers made quick work of the mostly paved roads arriving quickly and easily as the sun began to set on the next day, Sunday.<br>
            Seeing the hills flatten out into wide open farmlands as they approached, the roads fell to cobblestone then quickly fell to disrepair, leaving a less than happy taste in the Team's mouth as they approached a larger cluster of small, rundown wooden buildings scattered around a handful of bigger stone ones too.<br>

            At Krasus' direction, the party made their way through town to <a ariad-describedby="footnote-label" href="#TDP" id="TDP-ref">The Drunken Pig</a> where he was able to briefly reconnect with a Distant friend in the Barkeep, an Air Genasi named Swish.<br>
            Grabbing a bed and some light intformation from Swish, the Party opted for Town Hall, a tried and true strategy for them, and found themselves face to face with Mayor Odolina, a short brown-haired woman with powerful convictions and big goals in front of her.<br>
            Taking the opportunity to pick her brain, the party learned that there may be some Icarius sympathizers in town and that Racet, the Head Guard, would be a useful gossip if they could get her talking.<br>

            Thankfully that turned out to be even easier than suspected as she quickly laid out the only possible location for where Icarius would be, noting that a <a ariad-describedby="footnote-label" href="#Hermannus" id="Hermannus-ref">local farmer</a> was overheard discussing a small get together at his barnhouse that night.</a>
            She pointed out that it was a bit odd to be having a gathering at this season (due to the harvest) but hadn't really thought much about it....Till The Revengers connected the dots for her.<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            Heading directly to the barn, The Revengers quickly found themselves talking directly with locals who seemed to be running some sort of meet, greet, and transport for Icarius.<br>
            Dipping briefly into chaos, Adelvir let slip their purpose only to handle it quickly with a masterful casting of Charm Person, turning the tide back in their favor as they were welcomed inside and even managed to meet the former king!<br>
