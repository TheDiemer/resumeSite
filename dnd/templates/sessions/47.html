            Finishing off the Sword Spiders, choosing to double-back and explore everywhere, finding and avoiding a trap, and taking on a hoard of flameskulls, the Revengers fought bravely through the dark, hoping to find an end and get more power for this Lyre!

            Finding an odd mirror in a room tucked away led the party to be attacked by a copy of anyone that entered the room (which started with Adelvir, then Gisli, Wrench, Duvu, and Krasus)!
            Thankfully, Gisli attacked the mirror, in hopes of stopping new enemies from appearing, and managed to stop the enemies from attacking at all!
