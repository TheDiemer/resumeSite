        <a>
            Leaving Icarius in his cell and under a much closer eye, The Revengers took their leave of the Palace Prison and Orakh, heading back to The Oracle.<br>
            Upon arrival, she provided the simple, but nice white and gold accented robes she promised before they set off to meet the King.<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            Barging straight into the ornately decorated thrown room, The Oracle introduced The Revengers to the King himself and (most of) his Royal Court:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Alden Ordovician - Chief Scientist - small, dark-skinned gnome with very intricately mechanical goggles</li>
                <li>Tosrak Shieldwood - Lord Commander of the Order of Dawn - tall Dwarf in shiny high-quality armor</li>
                <li>Fristal Bexbal - Secretary of State - Green-skinned Dragonborn in simple, but nice brown robes</li>
                <li>Uthund Bexbal - High Priest of Tropolis - Slightly taller twin brother to Fristal, all white robes</li>
                <li>Innova Hishead - Hand of the King - Small fairy with green, orange, and yellow wings and comicly large ears</li>
            </ul><br>
            before she proceeded to inform the King about the prophecy, his father escaping, The Revengers getting him back, and that they have information regarding the bigger threat!!!<br>

        <a>
            Leaving the stage to Wrench, The Revengers informed the King about (almost) all of their escapades regarding the Eleusian Mysteries.<br>
            Through lots of back and forth, questions, and further explanations, the King seemed to get an understanding of the situation and asked how he could help, including, but not limited to, offering up the whole Army of Tropolis to invade Frjósöm.<br>
            After some brief discussion, The Revengers asked for only a handful of things:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>a platoon of especially notable, powerful, and experienced soldiers willing to volunteer for what is probably a suicide mission.</li>
                <li>a significant reward for that platoon, should they survive</li>
                <li>appropriate compensation for them, should they survive</li>
                <li>and some help preparing tools and armaments for the oncoming fight</li>
            </ol>
        </a>
        <a>
            The King agreed to their terms, allowing Alden to facilitate the preparing of tools and such, before asking The Revengers to depart as they had other matters to attend to, tho also briefly noting that Tosrak has no leg to stand on for sending the army westward after they learned all of this information.<br>
            Finally, as they left the thrown room, Krasus asked for a word with the King.<br>
            Stepping into a quiet corner, they briefly discussed the New Kingsmen, that they started from within his army during the last great war, started good by helping setup and maintain restrictions on places that fought for Icarius, how they turned dark and start killing and more, how Tosrak was a member but turned on them to help Arsenios root them out and kill most of their leadership, and finally that there are clearly some still using that name and he should handle that situation...before Krasus does...<br>
        </a>
        <a>
            Taking the chance to discuss Hephaestus, their forge, and some of her personal work decisions, Alden walked out talking to Gisli and inviting her back.<br>
            And we left the Party leaving the presence of The Oracle for the street access and leaving the palace!<br>
