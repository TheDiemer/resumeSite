            Leading them through a hallway of statues to the gods heading to her workshop, Alden winked at the The Revengers and suggested she call them Boomers before moving on to describe HER mission.<br>
            After learning of the tunnels under the Place, Alden was tasked with exploring, analyzing, and investigating to find weaknesses, other methods of entry, and anything else that might be down there.<br>
            Tucked into a magically hidden crack in the tunnels, she found a leatherbound notebook with only a few remaining pages, the rest having rotted away or not been there when the notebook was stored.<br>

            Reaching her impressive and organized workshop, she laid <a ariad-describedby="footnote-label" href="#Noillif-notes" id="Noillif-notes-ref">the pages</a> out for all to see and identified them as notes from Queen Noillif, the King's 14 great grandmother.<br>
            She went on to note that these are rumored to lead to a magical lyre that the queen used to fend off a problem with the dead but quickly ran into a wall and asked the Revengers for help.<br>
            Thinking outloud as a group, The Revengers and Alden were able to theorize that something might be with the Apollo and Hecate statues in the halls they just walked through.<br>
            Finding this to be true, the stone tablet drawn in one of the images was found in Apollo's hands, the crescent moon with holes was found hidden inside Hecate's statue, and putting the two together unlocked the secret hiding place on the statue where the Lyre has been hidden for these long years!<br>

            Taking it back to the workshop, Alden began reviewing the lyre but suffered what appeared to be seizure, but was what she described as an overpowering vision commonly from the Fates themselves.<br>
            Once she was able to tell them the whole story, she found the engravings on the fretboard and identified it as a infrequent symbol only associated with long standing rumors of a Labyrinth underneath Tropolis.<br>
