                Between their weapons, their magic, the assassins, and a T-REX, the Revengers quickly tore through the remaining necromancers and zombies till nothing was left above ground.<br>
                Taking a short rest to catch their breath and to <a ariad-describedby="footnote-label" href="#colosseumloot" id="colosseumloot-ref">searches the bodies</a>, the party setup safe ground on the second floor for a bit.<br>
                Heading down into the basement after their nap, the Revengers found more necromancers and their undead!<br>
                After many stabs in the dark and damaging AoE spells, everyone against the Revengers laid dead on the ground, not moving anymore.
