        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on May 25th, 2022:</h2>
        <p>
		<a>We rejoin our Revengers in the center of Old Tropolis right outside of the Temple to Ares, it is mid-afternoon, and Adelvir, having disappeared last night after we saw the death of Plequa, rejoins the party. He swaggered up, bringing a nebulous bag of pure darkness he claims to have gotten from his Mistress, The Goddess Nyx.<br>
		He recounts her description of the power, though noting he didn’t quite understand it himself, and Wrench sees similarities to the Bag of Unfavorable Winds that Odysseus was given on his great Homeric Adventure, having heard the traveling bards of yore tell the tale often. He notes that the party should be careful not to open the bag too wide without knowing that risks come with that.</a><br>
		<a>As they continue to stand in the heart of the city, the town crier announced great news of the trading guild coming public with the embezzlement scheme, giving proper PUBLIC credit to the Revengers, and that they expect prices will be stabilized and lowered within the week. With such a public announcement and whispers spreading quickly, The Revengers suddenly find themselves flush with opportunity!</a><br>
		<a>The Goddess Iris arrives to deliver message after message pouring in offering jobs to The Revengers! Before they can even accept the messages, a rainbow portal quickly appears, tearing a hole in the universe…Wrench gladly steps through, excited for the opportunity, with Gisli hot on his heels. Ayayron and the rest of the party, however, stay to hear the messages first.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>The first was a paid gig to test an estate’s security measures</li>
			<li>several others with similar “attempt to infiltrate for money” offers came in</li>
			<li>and a job from Rizzo with the Hands of Hephaestus. He notes it would be a lengthier job, about 2 weeks or so, as they escort some snobby rich person along the new road to the western cities.</li>
		</ul>
		<a>After hearing the last, for now, the rest of the party jumped through as well, teleporting elsewhere…</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a>As they were teleported through space, time, and well...something...else...The Revengers felt magic in a way none of them had experienced before, including the odd sensation that they were walking across a bridge while teleporting.<br>
		Landing in a dimly lit room of shiny, well-crafted, and well-sculpted gold, The Revengers find themselves in a large room with Nine ornate and intricate doorways, the largest Tree any of them has ever seen, indoors or out, and 6 humans standing near the roots. Two of the doorways are cracked, broken, and damaged beyond use, though even through the cracks in the walls, you see no light pushing through.</a><br>
		<a>After some discussion with the humans, The Revengers learn this to be another universe, one where the Greek Gods do Not rule, but instead, these Aesir gods seem to.<br>
		They felt some otherworldly, indeed other-universal, power and as they were in desperate need of help they reached out. They then share that their universe is in the middle of its prophesied cyclical end but if the last humans, Lif and Lifthrasir, are not able to get here, to this room with Yggdrasil then everything will go wrong and the cycle will Not restart. They are too weak and few in numbers to risk leaving here to find them, hence the need for mighty help.</a><br>
		<a>After The Revengers accept, the remaining Aesir suggests going to Midgard to find a portal to the afterlife, Folkvang, to ask Freya where she might’ve hidden the humans. As they do, the party notices a faint, green, magical tear near the tree that the Gods seem unable to see. Njord, the man speaking for them, indicates this is likely a portal Freya left behind to help reach her, and the Revengers' previous _Experience_ with death must enable them to access it.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a>As it turns out, Folkvang, or at least the part the Revengers see, is a large, wooden hall for the dead to party, serve Freya willingly, and enjoy forever. Having checked with the living Aesir first, Adelvir leans into his Bardic talents and beseeches Freya to help them help the Aesir through song, prosaic language, and a non-zero amount of flirtation.<br>
		Freya, a “known wild girl” according to one of the Aesir, happily accepts the Revenger’s offer of help, and after successfully giving Adelvir the look she also looks forward to accepting his <i>help</i> when they get back.</a><br>
		<a>She escorts them to a private room behind her throne, indicating they will have to go to Vanaheim, the former lands of the Vanir (older gods), where she hid the humans. Unfortunately, the best way there is through her magics which rely heavily on sleep and therefore chooses to warn the party that Sutr’s mistress, Sinmara, is known to haunt dreams and they should be wary.</a><br>
		<a>Falling asleep in a flash of green light, The Revengers wake in a green-tinted dream of a field with no sky to speak of. After a few moments, a bright green magical line begins to draw itself on the ground, leading away across the fields. After nearly an hour of walking along increasingly hilly and mountainous lands, the magical line sharply turns into one of the dark tunnels around the party.<br>
		A short walk through the darkness led them to Lif and Lifthrasir huddled closely around a tiny fire. After convincing the humans to come with them, the now larger party turned to leave...</a>
		<a>Only to be attacked by Sinmara, stepping out of the dreamscape and shadows.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Will the party be able to finish off Sinmara?<br>
			Will they return Lif and Lifthrasir to the Aesir and aid the Aesir through Ragnarok?<br>
			FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA ON ETURN PRIME</h2>
