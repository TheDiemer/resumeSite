        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on August 3rd, 2022:</h2>
        <p>
			<a>Heading straight into the home after little conversation with Flint, the Revengers quickly heard the crashing noise the harengon referred to.<br>
			   Briefly exploring the tiny home, Duvu lead the party into the only room (confirmed to be the bedroom) as the only location the noise could be coming from.<br>
			   Using his well trained ears and delicate fingers, Duvu found a hole underneath the bookshelf. After attempting, and failing, to quietly move the bookshelf with Adelvir, Duvu discretely called for the stronger team members to come help.<br>
			   Offending Wrench by softly suggesting the bot is incapable of being quiet, Duvu was quickly proven right as Wrench rushed over to it, had to adjust his grip a few times, and then <b>loudly dragged</b> it away from the wall.
			</a>
			<a>
				The party took in several details as they stared down into the gaping hole in the floor:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>There is no light down the stairs</li>
					<li>The hole itself looks like it was dug from the home side, along with the first several, roughly hewn stone steps</li>
					<li>About 30 ft into the darkness, the stairs transition into nicely formed, well planned and carved steps that look older than the dig near the top</li>
				</ol><br>
				Opting to try and regain any amount of secrecy, the party formed a chain with Wrench situated in the middle, as the only member without the ability to see in the dark.<br>
				They decended in the darkness for close to a minute, with the loud crashing noise growing louder and louder, though still avoiding any sense of rhythm or pattern.<br>
				As they reached the landing platform next to a door that clearly separated them from the source of the noise, most of the party heard a brief, dull <i>splat</i>.
			</a>
		</p>

				Turning around in the darkness, the majority of the party was able to see that their sight was...impared?<br>
				No...there was a large cube of some sort of gooey material that you all could see through but it was easy to identify.<br>
				Moving swiftly, Adelvir and Ayayron slammed it with magic before Gisli rushed in and demolished the goo with two Viscious swings of her hammer.
			</a>
			<a>
				As they regain their senses in the darkness, the crashing noise continues...<br>
				Leaving nothing left to do, the party entered the room and found 9 undead soldiers, with bows raised and swords slung, and 1 large, rotting undead minotaur slamming the back of his axe into the ground.<br>
				Jumping straight into action, the party did their best to whiddle away at the soldiers, leaving Gisli (and a guest appearance by Wrench) to put a beat down on the minotaur.<br>
				As the soldier's numbers dwindled, Ayayron, who spent the majority of the fight using what was clearly darker magics, brings one of the remaining soldiers down to a pile of bones using another dark spell...but stays connected for a moment as it then...reassembles itself and stares as him...<b>expectantly...<b></b><br>
			</a>

			<h2>Will the Sapphireshapers be able to pay up? and When? What about Hephaestus?<br>
				What will they do about the clear trap from Flint?<br>
				What is going on with Ayayron? Does he now have a zombie under his control?!?!<br>
				FIND OUT (maybe) NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA ON ETURN PRIME</h2>
