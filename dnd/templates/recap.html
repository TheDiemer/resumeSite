        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Tropolis, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h3>This is the recap for the session on March 16th, 2022:</h3>
        <p>
		<a>Picking up right where we left off, Duvu, Gisli, and Wrench were standing in a Hot and Sandy tunnel having just teleported to what they believe to be Frjósöm.</a><br>
		<a>Quickly heading back, the Revengers decided to get an early, and good, night's rest to prepare for a "training montage"!</a>
	</p><p>
		<a>Early the next day, the Hands of Hephaestus contacted Wrench to tell him that Gemma and 6 guards just got in a carriage and are preparing to leave in a westerly direction from the Paláti.</a><br>
		<a>Quick to head into Tropolis, the Revengers were able to get out of the city in time to see the carriage and track it from a distance.</a>
	</p><p>
		<a>Gemma and her guards headed to a small, densely wooded outcropping in the middle of some fields a couple hours outside of town, stopping and entering the woods before the Revengers arrived.</a><br>
		<a>Sending Little A in to scout ahead, they were able to locate 4 of the guards in the woods before finding Gemma in a clearing talking to...someone.</a><br>
		<a>Only seeing 3 of the individuals, though feeling the presence of more, Adelvir took over Little A's senses to listen in!</a>
	</p><p>
		<h4>It would appear that Gemma was hiring the individuals for a hit of an...intrusive and problematic group...</h4>
	</p><p>
		<a>Jumping right into trying to handle the problem, Adelvir and Duvu sneak up to the closest guard and sync their attacks, stabbing him through his armor straight into the small of his back, sending him to a knee...and Crying out in pain!!! Still alive, he alerted everyone nearby to the attack before being quickly dispatched.</a><br>
		<a>Heading deeper into the woods, the party triggered several of these shadowy figures to attack with their poisoned blades, bringing Duvu to a painful pause in damage and Ayayron to the brink of death before Killing one of them!</a><br>
		<a>The battle continues as Gemma escapes in her carriage, leaving the Revengers to try and deal with these mysterious hires...that all seem to have a number of VERY familiar brass rings...6, in fact...</a>

		<h2>Who are these people that Gemma hired? Assassins?!<br>
		What is "the usual payment" that she agreed to and what is trying to hide from The Revengers?<br>
		Will the Assassins win the day and finish their contract already or will The Revengers finish them off and head after their real target, Gemma?<br>
		FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA</h2>
