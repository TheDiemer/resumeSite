        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h3>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on April 21st, 2022:</h3>
        <p>
		<a>Despite being shaken awake by Krasus, who whispered "the boy is back in town" as he did so, <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#all" id="all-ref">The Revengers all</a> awoke surprisingly refreshed, with a fading, odd warmth they can only attribute to the times they've been in the presence of the Gods.</a><br>
		<a>He quickly informed them of his Brand of Castigation's sudden alert and they wasted no time, heading straight for the basement and to the teleportation circle to town.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Leading the way, Krasus quickly headed from the inner circle of old tropolis to the NorthWest, to the Upper district, where the rich-folk typically live.</a><br>
		<a>As they walked through the well lit night, Duvu then Krasus and finally Adelvir all noticed a figure that they seem to be unintentionally following.</a><br>
		<a>Generally shaped like an adult male elf, the figure kept a hood pulled low and had a sizable leather bag thrown over a shoulder and seemed to be making the same turns as the party, about 90 feet ahead.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>As they rapidly approached their destination, according to Krasus, the three of them attempted to draw the figure's attention and learn more about them.</a><br>
		<a>but he slipped inside a decent sized home nestled between two ostentatious mansions crammed into a city before the party could do too much.</a><br>
		<a>Not to be ditched, The Revengers chased the figure into the building as that was their destination too!</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Stepping into the foyer, Krasus offered "You there!" as their eyes adjusted to the relatively dim light indoors and saw the elf looking back in surprise and another figure behind him came into view.</a><br>
		<a>Wrench, Adelvir, and Ayayron recognized the elf as Katar Adquinal, Head servant to the Peokias family.</a><br>
		<a>And <u>none</u> of you recognized the tall, half-orc man with light gray skin and sizable tusks that almost reach his flat, wide nose with a faintly-green glowing rapier in his right hand.</a><br>
		<a>Though, Krasus' brand magic told him this was still Plequa!</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Diving immediately into combat with a holler <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#quote" id="quote-ref">"Just stand down and we will stop fighting"</a>, Gisli charged straight in, immediately killed Katar and sprinted closer to Plequa.</a><br>
		<a>After several minutes of grueling combat, Plequa and Duvu both laid bloodied, beaten, and broken on the ground.....</a><br><br>
		<a>Duvu, however, was healed a few moments later.</a><br>
		<a>As Wrench's trident plunged into Plequa's sizable half-orc body, which then collapsed to the ground, it faded and morphed into a smaller (though still ded), pale man that reminds you of his first face that you saw (at the party) though with a few features more exaggerated now (larger nose, wider mouth, bigger/bulgier eyes).</a><br>
	</p><p>
	<a>To tie off the night, Krasus opened the bag that Katar brought here secretly at nearly midnight,</a><br>
	<a>the bag that Plequa, even while in battle, tried to save...</a><br>
	<a>finding what the party has good reason to believe is a set of golden, _ornamental_ plate armor, à la:<br>
		<a  href="#link" id="armor-ref" aria-describedby="footnote-label"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='Golden_Armor.png') }}" alt="Peokias Ornamental Armor" width="500" height="auto" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='Golden_Armor.png') }}"></a>
	</a>
	</p><p>
	</p>
        <br>

		<h2>How did Plequa change his face?<br>
		What does this armor <u>do</u>?<br>
		Why would Gemma have given it to Plequa/Udgred?<br>
		FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA</h2>
