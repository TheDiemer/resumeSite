        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on June 29th, 2022:</h2>
        <p>
		<a>
			Continuing to track our split party, we find Ayayron resuming his exploration of the 3rd floor as a gaseous cloud!<br>
			Before moving down to the 2nd floor, he finished exploring the master bedroom and found a closet full of nice clothes and a Very sizable bathroom, including a large, perfectly circular bathtub.<br>
			On this new floor he found more sleeping dwarves, an office with a <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#note" id="note-ref">Small note</a> in a drawer, a guard that he easily dodged, and a Linen closet Full of nice linens of all kinds as well as what appears to be the entrance to a secret tunnel or panel at the back of the room...<br>
		</a>
	</p>

			The Distraction Division was doing a particularly good job of sneaking as they explored the secret basement finding 4 doors:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>a Huge high quality steel door with a sizable lock, blocking what appears to be a safe</li>
				<li>a set of double doors that led to what appears to be a boardroom</li>
				<li>a Master workshop with the nicest set of diamond smithing tools and a teleportation circle</li>
				<li>a large workshop with 7 workstations with diamond smithing tools, a drafting table with blank blueprints, a large forge, a diamond pickaxe, and a ladder leading up into the home.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Failing to break into the safe and taking a set of diamond smithing tools + the pickaxe with them, the Disctraction Division headed up the ladder into the unknown.
		</a>
		<a>
			The Sneak Squad did just that and made their way across the 1st floor, finding their way into a large library with floor to ceiling bookshelves on 3 walls, a billiards table, 6 fluffy chairs, and a large stairwell leading up to the second floor.<br>
			Finding a few books of interest, Krasus grabbed three scruffy looking, well-loved and used books from the shelves:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Refining with Mesegea</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Extremely well-worn pages discuss the <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#SoT" id="SoT-ref"><i>Sea of Tropolis</i></a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Grinders, Polishers, Drill Bits & More!</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Largely about the various tools used in refining gems.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>The Big ol' Book o' Rocks</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Largely about the various methods for extracting gems from Eturn.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Putting those books away, Duvu and Adelvir both heard the footsteps of a large half-orc woman starting to descend the steps nearby.<br>
			Throwing a plan together by himself, Krasus told Duvu to <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="hide" id="hide-ref">hide</a> and grabbed Adelvir, yanking him into a space kind of behind the stairs, he Yelled to draw her to them faster.<br>
			After she came down the rest of the way, they tied her up after she called for help both in the house and on a sending stone.<br>
			They were able to handle her Just as another guard descended the same stairwell, only to be handled with magic from both Krasus and Adelvir!<br>
			The Sneak Squad finally headed upstairs to the 2nd floor primarily taking the time to explore the hallway with its <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="desks" id="desk-ref">desks</a>, and stepping out onto the Patios!
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<a>
			As the guard yelled for help, Wrench and Gisli had found themselves climbing up into the Linen closet with Ayayron!<br>
			The newly expanded Distraction Division decided descending back down the ladder to give Ayayron a chance to open the safe.<br>
			Unfortunately, between his thieves' tools and creating a stone door in the wall, Ayayron was Also unable to get into the safe!
		</a>

		<h2>Will The Sneak Squad reunite with their second half?<br>
			Will they find anything that Ayayron didn't?<br>
			Will The Revengers find a way into the safe?<br>
			FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA ON ETURN PRIME</h2>
