        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on July 13th, 2022:</h2>
        <p>

			Willing to explore the rest of the house, the expanded Distraction Division used the Teleportation circle in the master workshop to travel away from the basement.<br>
			Ayayron quickly recognized the space as the master bathroom on the 3rd floor and also remembered that he hadn't opened the locked nightstands next to the master bed...<br>
			Resorting to digging in the pockets of the sleeping dwarves and picking locks, the stealthy fire genasi opened both drawers finding a small leather notebook, a very nice set of sapphire earrings and necklace, and 2 halves of a very large and ornate Key that looks like it belongs to the safe!
		</a>
		<a>
			Reversing the teleportation circle found in the tub, the Division hurried back to use the key!<br>
			Upon opening the large, though surprisingly light safe door, they found 20 blueprints explaining patents for various different but recognizeable sapphire objects, 3 <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#deeds" id="deeds-ref">deeds</a>, and the most money in one place that most of you have seen.<br>
			Taking all of the paper and approximately $121,000 worth of gold and platinum, using a fancy set of sheets Ayayron stole earlier, the Distraction Division teleported to the main floor lobby to await the morning!
		</a>

			Continuing to explore the 2nd floor, the Sneak Squad found that one of the 4 doors left on this floor teleported them to the office on the otherside of the floor. To make sure they found out what was behind that door, Krasus was able to cut through the wall and climbed into a closet.<br>
			After checking that thoroughly and briefly visiting the other rooms here, they found the secret tunnel that the Distraction Division clearly used and decided to go hangout downstairs till they could find their friends or the morning came.

			As the night slowly comes to an end, the Revengers sat and watched the staff come into the home, including the replacement security who mostly just looked confused, until the slumbering dwarves from above all came down together.<br>
			After the patriarch of the family announced his confusion at the sight before him, Bramwikara stepped forward, thanked the Revengers for their hard work in the night, and insisted that the family eat breakfast before dealing with payment, inviting the party to join them.
		</a>
		<a>
			After breakfast, the party presented all they had taken with them, showing off the full run of the house that they had:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>20 old patents</li>
				<li>a Diamon pickaxe</li>
				<li>3 deeds</li>
				<li>~$121,000 worth of gold and platinum</li>
				<li>10 additional newer patents</li>
				<li>3 older and frequently used books</li>
				<li>a glass of scotch</li>
				<li>a set of VERY high quality sheets</li>
				<li>2 halves of the safe key</li>
				<li>a gorgeous sapphire jewled necklace and matching earrings</li>
				<li>the notebook from the elder dwarf's nightstand</li>
				<li>a mason jar with something that resembles truffles or mushrooms</li>
				<li>Fancy dark salt in a grinder</li>
				<li>a pen and a couple notebooks from the entryway</li>
			</ul>
