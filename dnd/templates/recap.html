			Bramwikara finished her discussion with her brother and headed back to the group with a couple options:<br>
			<ol>
				<li><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#asp" id="asp-ref">Athena Stones of Protection</a></li>
				<li><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#dwarfRing" id="dwarfRing-ref">Rings of Dwarvenkind</a></li>
				<li>You give us a list of things you want (physical items, experiences, or whatever you can think of).</li>
				<li>You each get a sixth of the $121,000</li>
			</ol><br>
			Having presented the options, she then stepped back to give the team a chance to discuss and decide.

			Leaving the Sapphireshaper estate through their teleportation circle, the Revengers headed back home to recouperate, drop off some of Ayayron's money, and ask Ja'ar Visro about their recent patrons.<br>
			The majority of his knowledge indicated they had been in the area of Tropolis for a long time, some sources indicated they came to the area around the time of its founding by King Diemer, back in the year 632, with most of them noting that the Shayper name is attributed with gifting King Diemer and his lovely queen a giant sapphire they called the Sea of Tropolis.<br>
		</a>
		<a>
			Heading back to town, the Revengers had 3 goals in mind. First, to the Temple to Hephaestus, then to the market, and finally, following up with Flint Briartoad, a dark gray harengon that left them a job to help find out what is going on with his property in town.<br>
			At the temple, The Revengers sacrificed Wrench's Mace of Terror and had a lengthy conversation with the God of the Forge.<br>
			He promised to expedite their and Persephone's requests and helped confirm that Briggox appeared to still be on Frjósöm.<br>
		</a>		
		<a>
			At the market, Ayayron was able to visit the potion seller from before and bought more Palm oil of Sneaking, More potion of Gaseous form, additional Potions of Invisibility, and some of his oil of speed.<br>
			Krasus had other ideas and headed off in search of something to stick two items together. Taking the recommendation of the potion seller, he headed to "Gasula's Apothecary and more" where he bought some tree sap and some bee's wax.<br>
		</a>
		<a>
			And finally, they headed towards the address given in the job message and reviewed what they knew of teh job to come:<br>
			Flint Briartoad is a dark grey harengon with shockingly green eyes and he reached out because his house in the low end of town has been invaded by some sorta monster or spirit and he's scared to return. He seemed a little shifty as he dodged why he contacted you instead of the cops...<br>
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>Will the Sapphireshapers meet all of the requests?<br>
			Will Flint's job be a trap like several people think?<br>
			How will Hephaestus actually end up helping?<br>
			FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA ON ETURN PRIME</h2>
