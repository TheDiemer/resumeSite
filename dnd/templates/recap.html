        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on April 27th, 2022:</h2>
        <p>
		<a>As we rejoin the party, they stand over the golden armor spread on the table and the bodies of Plequa and Katar on the floor.</a><br>
		<a>Frail and small as both are, they fit in the leather bag Katar brought making it very easy to keep an eye on them till departure.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>The Revengers explored the rest of the home, finding a mostly un-lived in home. Clearly, Plequa preferred to spend time elsewhere...</a><br>
		<a>They also found a few other items on Plequa himself and around the master bedroom's desk and nightstands:</a><br>
		<ul>
			<li>4 daggers</li>
			<li>1 set of quality leather armor</li>
			<li>1 small black cipher, written in <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#lang" id="lang-ref">unknown language</a></li>
			<li>1 small <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#journal" id="journal-ref">journal</a></li>
			<li>1 ledger, written in the same unknown language as the cipher</li>
		</ul><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Heading back to Revenger Tower, the party asked Ja'ar Visro if he could read the language.</a><br>
		<a>To their luck he could and would successfully translate it, as well even use the cipher to interpret the ledger completely.</a><br>
		<a>Browsing through it, Wrench saw nothing but numbers...<br>
			thankfully Duvu was also looking and started to notice small discrepancies...<br>
			Tiny ones...<br>
			and recognizing vendor names from the market...</a><br>
		<h3>Plequa was stealing from the Trading Guild!<br>
			Copper Pieces off of a few transactions per vendor a year for over 30 years!!!<br>
			This is how he fills the coffers for Udgred and the Eleusian Mysteries!!!</h3><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>As they finished receiving this information and requesting Ja'ar duplicate his efforts, Wrench heard word that Gemma was on the move...first to Plequa's home and then quickly off to the merchant district before settling down inside a building.</a><br>
		<a>Taking off in pursuit, the party not only manages to find the building but work their way Into the room.</a><br>
		<a>Before the Guild Board Meeting they know is about to begin can get underway, Gisli is able to meet to stout Stark-Black haired dwarven men that greeted her kindly.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>As Gemma calls the room to order, she falls silent at the sight of Wrench, before regaining her composure and confronting the party in front of everyone.</a><br>
		<a>After a bit of a back and forth, she convinces the party to wait outside while the private board meeting convenes and <b>THEN</b> she will happily, and in front of the rest of the board if they so choose, talk with the Revengers.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Following a thorough conversation ranging from Plequa's thievery for decades (including FROM Gemma) to Her apparent lack of knowledge of Udgred over to her surprise at the news that her family ceremonial armor had been stolen and what she knew about it.</a><br>
		<a>Wrapping up the conversation, Krasus outright announced to the room that Gemma had hired assassins to kill them but they understand, just call them off...<br>
			oh, and The Revengers (them) killed Plequa!</a><br>
		<a>Gemma also promised to send word if she recalls any information that her reflection on her friendship with Plequa may reveal.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Moving quickly, The Revengers met with Izin to see how he was doing, only to be greeted by their weepy eyed friend happy to see them alive knowing the bounty was just called off from their heads and they <i>"survived Hands, thank Goodness the Masters weren't hired! Though...that Would be out of the usual for the organization that hired them."</i></a><br>
		<a>he also confirmed that all is well, the relationship with the Clippers is fine, <i>"its just money, surely you understand?"</i></a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Thinking onto their next task, The Revengers reflect on info they had:</a><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Udgred is planning to do something in just under <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#timeline" id="timeline-ref">3 weeks time</a> to finish his plot using Demeter somehow.</li>
			<li>Udgred has 3 Generals, <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#councilof7" id="councilof7-ref">The Council of 7</a>: <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#kinstus" id="kinstus-ref">Kinstus</a>, <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#plequa" id="plequa-ref">Plequa</a>, and <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#briggox" id="briggox-ref">Briggox</a>.</li>
			<li>They've now killed and removed Plequa from the playing field.</li>
			<li>They killed and rekilled Kinstus, though last they knew, someone had taken his body Back to Frjósöm where the EM's HQ is.</li>
			<li>They've never seen or encountered Briggox, as far as they know.</li>
		</ul><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Hoping to continue their work of whittling down Udgred's support, they sought Persephone's help to find Briggox.</a><br>
		<a>Beseeching her in her temple, they were lead to a private room and spoke with the goddess herself.</a><br>
		<a>She Confirmed the reception of Plequa's soul and the Loss of Kinstus' and that she would try to use some of her favors to ask the other gods about Briggox but could make no promises as she is not always the most beloved by her Olympic peers.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>By a stroke of ... something, Wrench and Gisli suggested that possibly Ares would help the god-employed party locate this "great warrior", Briggox, and maybe some sentimental connection to lost warriors (of Gisli's past).</a><br>
		<a>Only to find a frat house of meat head worshipers that sacrifice lambs at the foot of Ares' statue and break out into reverential roars of joy at any sign of the divine.</a><br>
		<a>Wrench pleaded with Ares to help them locate this warrior to help keep the status quo as they feel Udgred's upset would remove all possibility of war.</a><br>
		<a>To everyone but Wrench, nothing seemed to change as he prayed before hurling the sheep, but the instant it splattered against the wall, the Giant statue of Ares turned to look at Wrench and spat <b><i>"And why would I want to stop the greatest war of all time?"</i></b></a><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2>How will they find Briggox?<br>
			Will they be able to handle him whenever they DO?<br>
			Will they try to tackle Kinstus One More Time?<br>
			FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA</h2>
