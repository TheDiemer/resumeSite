				Before pushing them wide open, taking in the scene before her and charging forward, leading The Revengers headfirst into a battle unlike any other!<br>
			</a><br>
			<a>
				Trading blows, arrows, and magic, Briggox and his zombie army managed to bring Gisli to her knees before The Revengers began to hit back even harder!<br>

				As they faught, Briggox taunted Gisli with knowledge of her Grandson, Jyota, so as she brought him down, she chose to knock him out instead...<br><br>
				Taking the chance to interrogate Briggox away from Gisli, Ayayron instead chose to kill the towering goliath with his new found necromatic powers, just like how he (re?)killed and claimed his zombie friend...<br>
