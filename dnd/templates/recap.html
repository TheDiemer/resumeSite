        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on September 7th, 2022:</h2>

				Continuing on their rampage, The Revengers, including T-Rex Gisli, managed to demolish the remaining zombies and necromancers as their hired Cutters step forward and help them finish the fight.
			</a>
			<a>
				Finally having a moment to breath, everyone immediately <a ariad-describedby="footnote-label" href="#loot" id="loot-ref">searches bodies</a> before quickly moving to rest.<br>
				Taking a nap to heal up a bit, the cutters watched over them, still feeling well rested from easily killing off a number of zombies and necromancers on their own.<br>
			</a>
			<a>
				Moving onto the final portion of the colosseum not yet explored, The Revengers headed down into the darkness of the basement and found MORE Zombies and Necromancers!!!<br>
				Struggling slightly in the cramped space, our intrepid heroes managed to weather the storm until no more remained.<br>

				<li id="loot">Mostly finding incomplete masks, shortswords, and shortbows, the only loot worth anything was on Briggox. He wore Mithral Plate Armor, carried an extremely pointy longsword, and sadly, his giant Mace disappeared into a flash of green light about a minute after he died.<a href="#loot-ref" aria-label="Back to content">â†µ</a></li>
