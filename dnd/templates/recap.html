        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on August 31st, 2022:</h2>
        <p>
			<a>
				Despite a quick source of success, downing Briggox did not seem to turn the tide in the Revengers favor.<br>
				The skeletons remained to shoot down Adelvir's griffon and it quickly became clear that Briggox wasn't the only non-Revenger in the colosseum that could use magic!<br>
				Several spellcasters caused many headaches for the Revengers as Gisli and Duvu both got trapped by some magic that kept knocking them on their asses as their friends tried to save them and hold off the enemies.<br>
			</a>
			<a>
				Tanking hit after hit, Gisli managed to hold off most of the damage that would've killed a normal dwarven grandmother, before Adelvir, seeing an opportunity to help a friend AND the entire party, TURNED HER INTO A <i>TYRANNOSAURUS REX</i>!!!<br>
				At the same time, Ayayron began using his pair of zombies to slow a magical hand, rescue Duvu from a poisonous cloud, and prepared to rescue Smimdap and Witha!<br>
				Continuing to move the battle in their favor, Wrench and Krasus took to the seats above the grounds and found a Whole other set of combatants to handle!!!<br>
			</a>
			<a>
				TEARING through several of the necromancers taking potshots at the team below, Krasus unleashed his power on the hiding cowards.<br>
				Having shifted the focus of the spellcasters on the second floor and ADDING A T-REX TO THE MIX also pushed forward the success on the ground!<br>
				Several skeletons remain visible, a couple necromancers too, but after a few swift choices the Revengers ended the night in a much better position than where they started!<br>
			</a>
		</p>

			<h2>Despite the change in momentum, will it be enough for The Revengers to succeed?<br>
				Will they all make it out alive?<br>
				As they explore the 2nd floor, will they ever find the Hands that they hired? Are they even DOING anything?<br>
				FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA ON ETURN PRIME</h2>
