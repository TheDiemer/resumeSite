        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on August 10th, 2022:</h2>
        <p>
			<a>Watching from the street, Krasus saw Flint head into the home a few minutes after the Revengers did, only to leave a moment later.<br>
				Sadly, giving chase did not work as the small Harengon disappeared into the afternoon crowds, leaving Krasus to head back to the house and enter after his friends.<br>
				Joining them in the basement as the battle came to it's conclusion, Krasus aided the party in investigating the remains that they helped generate, noting that the Minotaur likely spent some amount of time (either alive or REalive) in the slaver fighting pits he knew of further west.<br>
			</a>
			<a>Shoving the Battle Axe from the Minotaur, the 9 longswords and 9 shortbows from the zombies, PLUS the Minotaur's intact horn into Adelvir's Portable Hole from Nyx, The Revengers headed upstairs intent on leaving.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a>Having observed the room thoroughly before descending, the majority of the party notices a letter on the table that was NOT there before.<br>
				Only able to assume that Flint left the letter, Krasus picked it up and found it addressing "<i>The Revengers</i>". Opening it up, Krasus read aloud:<br><br>
				<span id="letter">
				Once again, the great Revengers overcome the odds and save the day. Then again, our funeral gift to Plequa pales in comparison to some of the feats you've overcome.<br>
				After all, how could an undead minotaur ever compare to wiping an entire mountain off the face of Mesegea? As predictable as you are, however, <i>we</i> are a little disappointed to know that you thought you could get away witha obvious rat like <i>him.</i><br>
				That said, I suppose a stiff drink inebriates even the clearest of minds.<br>
				Regards,<br>
				Briggox<br><br>
				P.S. If you think you can save them, I hear the old Colosseum in Demopeion is pretty empty these days.

			<a>Realizing that Briggox found out about Smimdap running Getra and that he and Witha are in danger, the Revengers lept into action planning to recruit help, rest up, and head straight to the colosseum the next morning, knowing it to be close to Revenger Tower.<br>
				Starting first with the Merchant's Guild, The Rengers hoped to cash in on the good will they built discovering Plequa's dealings.<br>
				They unfortunately found themselves stifled by the hour. The final clerk, held up briefly by Adelvir, informed them that the guild was closed for the day and they could return promptly at 8 am the next day and receive help.<br><br>
				Moving onto the Clippers Guild, Izin was able to give them the current <a ariad-describedby="footnote-label" href="#cutprice" id="cutprice-ref">pricing "guidelines"</a> to determine how many assassins and of what level they want to hire for helping play a little backup defense for the Revengers, making sure to note that these prices aren't fixed but they would also get a discount, ultimately.<br>
				Deciding to take this with them and hire in the morning, they moved onto the Hands of Hephaestus to ask Rizzo if they could spy on the Colosseum for them.<br>
				Handing him 10 gp, Rizzo ran off to grab a friend and make their way there asap!
			</a>
			<a>
				Finally, heading home to rest, The Revengers made it back to the Tower to be greeted by Ja'ar Visro as they collapsed into their beds.
			</a>
		</p>

			<h2>When will The Revengers ever get paid?<br>
				How many Assassins will they hire to help?<br>
				How big of a trap has Briggox laid? And will it be enough to Stop our Heros?!<br>
				FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA ON ETURN PRIME</h2>
