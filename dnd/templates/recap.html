        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h3>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on April 13th, 2022:</h3>
        <p>
		<a>With the party deep in combat, Gisli, realizing her friends were fighting for their lives and now was NOT the right time for a bathroom break, charged head first into woods drawing the attention of the remaining guard.</a><br>
		<a>After seeing their fatal friend fall to the ferrous familiar of the fiends fighting them, the remaining assassins fled into the woods leaving the party to demolish the poor guard abandoned by their patron.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Briefly discussing their plans, the Revengers settled down in the, now empty, woods to rest for an hour before heading back to town, knowing that the HoH would alert them if Gemma went anywhere but to the Palati.</a><br>
		<a>Ultimately deciding to press their luck and follow Gemma back to the Palati itself, The Revengers attempted to send Duvu, the Rogue, inside to investigate and possibly explore previously unseen rooms.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>While the rest of the Revengers spent an hour playing small games, bonding, and trying to sell...recently acquired used armor, Duvu tried to put his powers of stealth to good use.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		<a>Sneaking up the servant's path, he found the back door guarded before choosing to climb up the walls and pillars themselves (due to his magical nature this was as easy as casting a spell).</a><br>
		<a>Seeing guards on all of the floors but no Gemma, he ultimately turned himself invisible and made his way into the Palati where he attempted many tactics to draw the guards away or distract them in some way.</a><br>
		<a>Sadly for Duvu, none of his efforts worked and nearing an hour of invisibility, he opted to leap from the 3rd floor balacony, nearly 150' in the air, before landing softly as if a feather.</a><br>
	</p><p>
		 
		<a>Knowing no other possible leads at the moment, the Revengers headed back to Revenger Tower to sleep and truly recover from their Brutal fight earlier that day...</a><br>
		<a>but after only an hour or so, Krasus sits bolt upright from his less than impressive sleep, having been yanked into consciousness by his Brand of Castigation alerting him that Plequa,</a>
		<h3>the Man in Purple,<br>
		the Master of Coin for the Eleusian Mysteries,<br>
		and one of The Council of 7,<br></h3>
		<a>is no longer on Frjósöm...</a>
		<h2>Hes in Tropolis!!!</h2>
	</p>
        <br>
	<p>
		<h2>Why is Plequa back?<br>
		What DOES Gemma know?<br>
		When will the assassins strike next?<br>
		FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA</h2>
