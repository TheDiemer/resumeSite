        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on August 17th, 2022:</h2>
        <p>
			<a>
				Waking as the sun crawled across the horizon, the Revengers settled into breakfast from Ja'ar Visro as Wrench accepted their Iris call update from Rizzo himself<br>
				Thankfully it appears they paid the right changeling, as he notes they were able to explore the exterior of the building pretty easily and found 8 normal humanoids and ~25 or so zombies crawling around the fighting grounds and the 2nd floor seats.<br>
			</a>
			<a>
				Taking this info to town, The Revengers started back at the Merchant's Guild, able to secure a meeting with Gemma after a short 30 minute wait.<br>
				Asking for the first of many forms of payment, The Revengers asked Gemma to merely "pay for the same level of Cutter's she hired to take them out".<br>
				Without even hesitating, Gemma grabs 800pp, puts them in a bag, and hands it right over to The Revengers, "Done. This covered the 7 Hands I hired."<br>
			</a>
			<a>
				Continuing to move quickly, The Revengers headed to the Cutter's Guild to hire 7 Hands for themselves as well.<br>
				Thanks to their good standing with the Guild and the work they asked for, The Cutter's Guild was able to accept 700pp per day at the standing rate.<br>
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a>
				Choosing speed, The Revengers used their knowledge of the secret tunnels and transportation circles to quickly head to the Tower before setting out on foot for the Colosseum.<br>
				After multiple hours, the sun has set and The Revengers+7 Hands found themselves at the South-Eastern-most entrance to the Colosseum!<br>
			</a>
			<a>
				Pulling a Longbow and his Zombie out of the portable hole, Ayayron prepped for a different type of fighting and told his zombie to lead the way for the sake of secrecy.<br>
				Duvu took up the leading postion for the rest of the Party behind the zombie, and Wrench told the 7 Hands to find the 2nd floor and handle as much as they can.<br>
			</a>
			<a>
				After making their way inside, the Hands split from the party, disappearing into the darkness, hopefully to handle things upstairs.<br>
				Quickly and quietly almost completing a full lap of the interior building surrounding the fighting grounds, Duvu found himself blocked by rubble (which also blocked an exterior door)...<br>
				Except it was an illusion!!! And revealed a masked wizard hiding inside his illusionary rubble!<br>
			</a>
			<a>
				Acting swiftly and quietly (mostly), the Revengers deftly dispatched the dark magician and turn towards the door leading inward...<br>
				Toward Briggox...<br>
			</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>How successful will the 7 Hands be?<br>
				Are the Revengers properly prepared?<br>
				Is Briggox ready for the fight of his life?<br>
				FIND OUT NEXT TIME ONNNNNNN, THE REVENGERSSSSS OF MESEGEAAAAAAA ON ETURN PRIME</h2>
