        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Tropolis, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h3>This is the recap for the session on March 2nd, 2022:</h3>
        <p style="font-size:0.75em;">
	    <a>As Rizzo stepped out of the warehouse in stepped a beautiful humanoid woman with pale skin and dark hair. Many of you recognize her as Persephone, goddess of agriculture and part ruler of Hades (the place). She steps forward and pleads with you to move quickly in your mission to stop Udgred as she believes her mother, Demeter, will sacrifice herself to give Udgred what he wants in 3 weeks time... At your request, Persephone agrees to try and bring you some sort of gifts (either from her husband, Hades, or her half-brother Hephaestus) within the week to aid in your task, as well as agreeing to try and "talk Gisli up" to Hephaestus, due to her desire to work in his forges after passing.</a><br>
	    <a>From there, the Revengers agreed to blindly accept a mission without gold payment from the Hands of Hephaestus in order to have them report constant updates on Gemma until otherwise stated! Sporadically throughout the day, Wrench receives private missives in his ear informing him that Gemma appears to be holed up in the Paláti all day. Between talking to Rizzo about another job (stealing wire art from whomever bought it last night at the party), discussing the Clipper's Guild with Izin, and purchasing various items in the market (including a fun conversation with a gnome merchant, Giddig, who claims to have 17 mouths to feed and sold healing potions, poisons, and ...viagra...?), the Revengers spent the majority of the day in the city, walking all over town. Finally heading back to Revenger Tower in order to explore the tunnels underground.</a><br>
	    <a>Once there, Ja'ar Visro told them that he did find a few scrap pieces of paper that noted a couple of the tunnels, which are all labeled with a greek letter. The tunnel that heads to Tropolis is tunnel Α (alpha) and includes some small notation that appears to indicate a shortcut of some kind...Thankfully our sharp eyed rogue and grandma caught glimpse of a faint blue glow before finding a crack in the tunnel that lead to a teleportation circle!!! This circle takes Wrench and Krasus Directly to the other end of the tunnel, Right outside the exit to the tunnel under Tropolis!!! Heading back, Wrench took Gisli and Duvu to find the shortcut mentioned in the Theta tunnel as well. Taking much longer to find it but succeeding in the end, the three of them used the circle (the rest stayed behind to avoid teleportation and/or protect the base) and appeared in a land further west but unfamiliar to all of them. To their benefit, Gisli realized she recognized the stone upon which they stood, noting it came from (at least) the foothills of the mountains on the West coast of Mesegea! Stepping out, above ground, they were greeted by lots of rolling, grassy hills periodically broken by rocky outcroppings, like the one which their tunnel stuck out of. Heading back, the party was determined to find a path that lead to Frjósöm...</a><br>
	    <a>Trying Beta tunnel next, they spent the better part of an hour looking for a shortcut to no avail. Moving onto Omicron, the last tunnel heading Directly east, they searched once more for a teleportation circle...and after nearly 40 minutes of walking down dead-ends and crawling along walls looking for cracks, Wrench and Duvu found one more circle, and teleported to the other side.</a><br>
	    <a>As the darkness and pressure the party has come to associate with teleportation fades, Wrench, Duvu, and Gisli are hit with an unrelenting Heat and see sand swirling around the the rocky ground they stand on...</a><br>

	    <h2>Is THIS Frjósöm??<br>
	    Will the Hands of Hephaestus successfully find the Art? What about moments of quiet with Gemma?<br>
	    What will Persephone return with?<br>
	    All this and more, Next time on THE REVENGERS OF MESEGEAAAAAAAAAAA</h2>
