        <h1>This is the most recent recap of the adventures of The Revengers of Mesegea of Eturn Prime, a.k.a. Eric's Campaign!</h1>
        <h2>This is the recap for our most recent session, which took place on June 22nd, 2022:</h2>
        <p>
		<a>
			As the Revengers settled back home at Revenger Tower back in their own world, they also reviewed their Iris Messages, as they had just received several job offers!<br>
			One of the earliest offers, and one they seemed to find interesting, was an offer from one of the local wealthy families, the Sapphireshapers.<br>
			They want the Revengers to test their security! Having recently received a threat, they just want to make sure it all works as expected!<br>
		</a><a>
			Calling Bramwikara Sapphireshaper in the morning, the Revengers accepted the job and came to the estate at her request.<br>
			Once there, she introduced the job more thoroughly and indicated that payment will be based on what they take, as long as they honestly admit to taking it.<br>
		</a><a>
			Using the day for planning, including the purchasing of potions, changing into servant clothes, and hiring Izin to investigate the comings and goings for the day, the Revengers prepared as best they could.<br>
		</a>

		<a><h3>As agreed, the party split three ways:</h3><br>
		<br>
		The "Sneak Squad" of Duvu, Adelvir, and Krasus picked the lock on the back gate and found their way inside via the door on that back patio.<br>
		Taking their time to look for traps, Duvu and Krasus spotted what looks to be a love Iris Camera of some kind, moving along the floor in a set pattern, watching...easily able to dodge around it though, they continued on into the home. Finding their way to the dining room, lounge area, and the kitchen!
		<br>
		<br>
		Ayayron, off on his own, used his Potion of Gaseous Form and flew up into a cracked window on the 3rd floor. There he found a decent sized room mostly dominated by 2 large desks.<br>
		Not seeing anything obvious of note here, he moved out of the door to this room and found himself on the 3rd floor landing. Seeing a row of simple, not-lockable doors across from a row of Lockable doors, Ayayron opted to explore the lockable doors first. These turned out to be a row of bedrooms, capped by a shared bathroom, each room with a set of sleeping dwarves!<br>
		Thankfully a cloud makes little noise and Ayayron moved beyond this to the other end of the hall where he found a much more impressive set of doors.<br>
		This was another bedroom, though a much bigger one with a couple doors off of it.
		<br>
		<br>
		And finally, the "Distraction Division" of Gisli and Wrench waited a few minutes, as previously agreed, and followed into the pool area.<br>
		Noticing that their friends skipped RIGHT past the poolhouse, they started their search there and quickly found a secret tunnel!!!<br>
		Climbing down the ladder under the secret trap door, Gisli quickly came back up to allow Wrench time to apply his Palm Oil of Sneaking and make them both invisible.<br>
		Descending while decidedly more prepared, Gisli and Wrench find themselves in a sizable room with 2 desks on opposite walls with 2 doors split between the other two walls.<br>
		The 2 desks each had two guards (1 Red Dragonborn, 1 Blue Dragonborn, 1 slender and young looking elf, and 1 towering half-orc) each staring at an Iris Call that seems to be inspecting various rooms in the Estate!<br>
		Acting quickly, the pair paralyzed the 4 guards with magic and then tied them up, taking control of the security room.
