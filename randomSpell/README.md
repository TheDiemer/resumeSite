<h1>This tooling is intended to make randomly selecting a spell/cantrip to cast in D&D 5e easier</h1>

<p>I will be playing a character that is a magic user that has no knowledge or understanding of magic and therefore has little to no control over it (at least to begin with).</p>

<p>This means that the character will point their fingers at a friend (intending to heal them), push inside themselves a bit, say some hokey words and I will roll 1d100. I will determine if he meant a cantrip or spell, and then take the roll, put it into this site and be given the cantrip or spell to cast as well as the details of said cantrip/spell.</p>

<h4>Current Features</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Cantrip vs Spell</li>
 <li>Checks that you have given it a number (vs. text)</li>
 <li>Presents the Spell/Cantrip name and details</li>
</ul>

<h4>This will be an ever evolving tool so here are notes for the future that I will move to the above section as I implement them:</h4>
<ul>
 <li>offense vs defense</li>
 <li>spell levels</li>
</ul>
