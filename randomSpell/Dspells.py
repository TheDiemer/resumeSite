If it succeeds, the spell ends.\nEither way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature\'s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.\nYou can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can\'t see.\nWhen you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you.\nThe spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.\nYou can\'t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn\'t speak any language.\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can\'t see it, but it must still be within range.\n\n* - (a copper piece)'],

Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.\n\nIf the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.\n\n\nEnlarge. The target\'s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category-- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn\'t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\'s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target\'s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.\n\nReduce. The target\'s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category--from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\'s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target\'s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can\'t reduce the damage below 1).\n\n* - (a pinch of powdered iron)'],

The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.\nA target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.\nIf you choose a target that is held shut with <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-lock">arcane lock</a>, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.\nWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.'],

The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.\n\nThe target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target\'s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell\'s range.\nWhen the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.\n\n* - (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)'],

Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it\'s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\n\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell\'s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\n\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack\'s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\n\nA duplicate\'s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\n\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can\'t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/monsters#Blindsight">blindsight</a>, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/monsters#Truesight">truesight</a>.'],
